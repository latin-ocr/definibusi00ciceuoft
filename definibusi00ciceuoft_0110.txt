18 CICERO DE FINIBUS 1.

for I do not want my case to break down through antipathy
to a word.) The life of men is especially troubled through
their ignorance of things good and evil 3 and by reason of
that fault they are often deprived of very great pleasures,
and tortured by terrible mental pains. They must, there-
fore, make use of wisdmn, since, by removing terrors and
desires, and by stripping away the rashness of all false
doctrines, she offers herself to us as the sui-est of guideS.
For wisdom is the only thing to ‹lrive sorrow from our
minds, to suffer us not to shudder with fcar : with wisdom
as our instructress, the ardour of all desires quenched, it is
possible to live in peace. For desires are insatiablffi they
overthrow men not merely one by one but whole houses,
and often cause the entire state to totter. (44) From
desires spring hatreds, divis-lons, strifes, rebellions, wars.
And these do not only air themselves abmad, nor do they
only rush blindly on others 3 but within 118, shut up in our
very minds‚ they wrangle and wrestle with one another.
Hence, of necessity life is made most bitter, so that only the
wise man, pruning and *cutting down all vanity and error,
and content with nature's bounds, can live without anxiety
and without sear.

pr actical ancl more adapted for living well 'than that used
by Epicuius2 He laid down one kind of such desires as
were alike natural and necessar‘y , 3 second, of such as were
natural without being necessary3 3 third, of such as were
neither natural nor necessary. The theory of these three is
that the necessary ones are satisfied by little effort, and that
not heavy. (46) Even the natural desires do* not want much,
because nature itself 1138 Γ101108, easy to prepare and-ljmjssod
in amount, with which she is contented 3 but of vam desires
there can be found no measure and no end.

XIV. ‘⁴ But, if we see the whole of life thrown into
confusion through mistakes and ignorance; if we see that
wisdon] alone rescues us from the onset of our lusts and from
the terror of our fears; teaches us to bear patiently the
assaults of fortune itself‚ and shows all the ways which lead
to peace and rest, why should we hesitate to say both that
