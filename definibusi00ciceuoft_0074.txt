referta z from vvfercio, not from restra, the pass. part. of which is
relata. See G. ξ 147.

nec . . . quiequam: se. aliud or praeterea. Torquatus does not
want to say that the mind has no place where it can stop aa a boun-

vivatur ε as a rule an intransitive verb (119. rivo) cannot have a
passive, but in Latin intransitive verbs are often used impersonally
in the passive. Cf. Jm9natum est, itum or ventum erat.

ad id autem : notice the demonstrative id takes the place of the
relative qumi: in English we should probably keep the relative,
“ which itself is referred to nothing else, but to which all things are
referred.'' The change from the relative to the demonstrative is
generally made when the two words (as quod and id here) are in
different cases.

res referuntur omnes ; Boeckel thinks that res is an interpolation
caused by repeating the re of referuntur.

XIII. istae vestrae virtutes: (κῃ. sa pientia, temperantia, fortitudo,
