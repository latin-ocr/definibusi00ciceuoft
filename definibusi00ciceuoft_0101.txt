VII. (22) Again, in the second part of philosophy, which
'deals with enquiry and discussion, and is called Logic, your
friend 15, as it seems to me, altogether defenceless and un· -
protected. He does away with definitions3 he gives no
instructions about division and classification3 he does not
tell us how reasoning is conducted and concluded ; he does
not show in what ways fallacies are detected and ambiguities
distinguished. He attributes judgment concerning things
to the senses, and if anything false has once been taken as
true by them he considers that all means of judging of true
and false are removed. (23) But he insistas, most of all,
perhaps, on what natuie 115611, as he himself says, ordains
and approves, i. e.‚ pleasure and pain. To these he refels
everything, both what we plusne and what we avoid. And
although this 15 Aristippus’ point, and is better 111111 more
ingenuously maintained by the Cyrenaics, yet 1 deem it
such that nothing seems more unworthy of a man. For to
my mind, nature has produced us and shaped us for some-
thing greater. I may be wrong, but I clo think this, that
that Torquatus who first came by this name, neither took
away that necklet from the enemy in order to feel any
pleasure in his body in consequence of that act, nor fought
with the Latius on the Veseris in his third consulship for
the sake of pleasure. Nay, in that 116 smote his son with
the axe, he seems to have even deprived himself of many
pleasures, since he put the majesty 01 the state and the
government before nature itself and a father’s love. (24)
And how about that Τ. TorquatuS, consul with Cn. 01 tavms
