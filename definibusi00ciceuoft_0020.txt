that nothing could be known, and which occupied itself by
balancing opinions first one way and then another, was
especially congenial to orators and advocates—of which class
there were a large number at Rome.

Such were the leading thinkers of antiquity down to the
time of Cicero: such, in the bar-est outline, was their
thought. In order to get a firm grasp of the history of
the philosophical question which forms the subject of this
book, Mr. Mayor‘s ›S'ketclc of Ancient Philosophy from Thale-8
to Cicero (Pitt Press, 33. 6cl.) should be consulted. Perhaps
the relation of Roman philosophising to Greek philosophy
at its best, could hardly be put better than in Mommsen's
words. “ Even the philosophie activity of the Hellem'c
mind had, when it began to exert influence on Rome,
already left the epoch of productive speculation far behind
it, and had arrived at the stage at which not only is there
no origination of really new systems‚ but even the power
of apprehending the more perfect of the older systems begins
to wane, and men restrict themselves to the repetition, soon
passing into the scholastic tradition, of the less complete
dogmas of their predecessors. The enchanted draught of
spemdation, always dangerous, is, when stale‚ certain

poison.''

ξ 5. Analysis of De Finibus, Book I.—CHAPS. LIV.—
Introduction, dedication to Brutus. Cicero’s intention to
treat‚ in Latin, subjects already handled by Greek philo-
sophers. (ξ 1) This intention is disapproved of by four
classes of people: (1) those who oppose philosophy alto-
gether3 (2) those who think only a very moderate amount
of time should be given to it (ς ξ 2, 3) ; (3) those who prefer
the Greek originals (ἐξ 4-10) 3 and (4) those who say this
study is unworthy of a prominent Roman statesman ( ξ ξ 10-12).
Cicero answers all these objections, and concludes by affirm-
ing that the importance of his subiect—viz. what is the
chief good, what is the end and object of a good life?—
imposes upon him the necessity of investigating it and
bringing it before his fellow—citizens.
