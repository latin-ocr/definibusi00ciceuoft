12 CICERO DE numus 1.

Democritus were attacked and corrected by Epicurus, For
the present, Ι will speak of pleasure. What Ι shall say
will not be new, yet I trust 511011 -15 you will appi-ove. ’'

“Assure(lly‚‘'' said I,- ίΙ will nothe obstin a;te 111(1 will leadily

(29)‘ ‘1 shall piove it‚'’ said 110,ί ‘if 01111* you aie as fair as
y ou look. But I would 1 athei adopt a continuous discourse
than the method of question and answer.⁷' “As you please‚'⁷
Ι answered. Then he began to spe-ak.

author of this system is content to do3 Ι will determine
the nature and character of what we are investigating‚
not because Ι imagine you 'to be ignorant, but that my
discourse may go on logically and systematically. We are
seeking what is the last and ultimate good. This, in the
opinion of all philosophers, ought to be such that every

therefore, he affirms, no need of reason or of discussion why
pleasure is to be sought for and pain to be avoided. These
truths he holds to be felt, as we feel the warmth of fire,
the whiteness of snow, and the sweetness of honey: none of
which we have to demonstrate with elaborate reasonS. It
is enough simply to note them. For there is a difference
between arguing and the drawing of a conclusion on the
one hand, and merely calling attention to and pointing out
a thing on the other3 by the one hidden and, as it were,
involved things are laid bare3 by the other things manifest
and on the surfaee are determined. For since we have
nothing left us when our senses are taken away, it must
needs be that nature itself judges what is in accordanoe
with, or in opposition to, herself. And what does she take,
