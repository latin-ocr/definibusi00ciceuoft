ξ 1. Marcus Tullius Cicero, the greatest of Roman
orators, was born at Arpinum in 106 Rc. His family was
of equestrian rank, but had never held any office in Rome.
Cicero was accordingly a novus homo, and his struggle to
obtain the praetorship and consulship was on that account
made harder. He was sent while still a young lad to Rome,
and there studied under the best masters, such as Archias.
In B.c. 91 he assumed the coya virilis, and then attended
the lecturos of orators and lawyers, He was entrusted by
his father to the special care of Mucius Scaevola the Augui,
from whose side he hardly evei departed. At that time
one of the easiest methods of obtaining fame and success
was by means of orator,y and as Cicero had a natural
talent for this art, he cultivated it in preference to devot—
ing himself to a military life. However, he served, as was
usual with young Romans who aspired to public office, one
campaign, and this happened to be in the Social War
(89 Re.) under Cn. Pompeius Strabo (the father of Pompey
the Great). For the next six years he took no part in
public affairs, but devoted his time to the study of rhetori(-
and the various schools of philosophy 3 from Phaedrus he
learned the Epicurean system, from Philo that of the New
Academy, and from Diodotus that of the Stoics.

The first of his extant speeches is that Pro P. Quinctio,
which was delivered in 81 B.c. Two years later, in a
crimina] trial, he defended Sextus Roscius Amerinus, whose
accuser was Chrysogonus, the powerful freedman of Sulla.
