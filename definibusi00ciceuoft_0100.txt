8 CICERO DE Flmssus 1.

each thing is made, and (2) the force which makes
each thing. They (11501155 the material, but omit the
efficient force and cause. This is a fault common to them
both 3 but the following are disastrous mistakes peculiar to
Epicurus. For he thinks that those same indivisible and
solid bodies are carried straight downwards in a line by
their own weight‚ that this is the natural movement of all
bodies. (19) Τ11611 the very moment it occurred to him that
if all things were carried down perpendicularly, and, as I
said, in a straight 11116, 0116 atom would never be able to
come into contact with another, the ingenious man brought
in something quite fictitious. He saw that the 6130111 (11-
verged, though in the smallest possible degree, and that thus
was brought about that connection, joining, and contact of ’
atoms with one another, by which were made the world and
611 the parts of the world and al] that therein is. The
whole thing is 6 childish invention, and it does not even
account for what he wants. For the divergence itself is
introduced arbitrarily, he says, in fact, that the atom di-
' verges without any cause, and nothing is less creditable to a
physicist than to talk about anything taking place without
cause. And, in addition to this, he deprived, without any
cause, the atoms of that mode of movement which is natural,
as he himself recognised, to all heavy bodies when making di-
rect for a lower position, and yet did not obtain the result for
the sake of which he had invented this peculiarity. (20) For
if all the atoms 616 10 diverge none will ev 61, combine, if some
616 to div erge, whilst others 616 130 111ον6 in 6 straight line
at their own will, 111 1116 first place this is to assign, as it
were, “provinces '' to atoms—-some to fall perpendicularly,
some obliquely 5 and in the second place, that same dis-
ordered concourse of atoms, in respect of which Democritus
too gets into difficulties, will not suffice to produce this
orderly world.

Then, again, it is not at all like 6 physicist to believe
that anything is the smallest thing—an idea which Epicurus
would assuredly never have dreamt of had he but preferred
to learn geometry from his friend Polyaenus rather than
unteach him as he did. To Democritus, 65 6 well-informed
man, and perfect in geometry, the sun seems large-to
