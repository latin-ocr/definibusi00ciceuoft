ξ 21. quae εἴδωλα nominant: Epicurus held that every body gave
off strom its surface certain small particles‚ each particle representing
the original body in miniature. These particles struck against the
eye of a person, and rushing thence with great spced to the soul or
brain, produced the idea of the body or object in the mind. ln this
book Cicero uses several Greek terms, aq. εἴδωλα, ἀπειρία, λογική,
τέλος; but as a rule he avoids them, and invents appropriate Latin
. nivalents.
