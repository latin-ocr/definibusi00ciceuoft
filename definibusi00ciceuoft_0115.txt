XVIII. “Oh! how truly happy is the open, simple,
and straightforward life ‹›f happy living! For inaslnuvh
as nothing can be better for a man than to be free from all
pain and trouble, and to'thoroughly-enjoy the greatest
pleasuresof mind and body, do you not see how nothing
is left out that aids life, that we lnay the ιιιοιϊ easily
attain what was set before usr -the hig-rhest good ’.Ι Epicurus
(whom you aver to haye been given over too lauch to
