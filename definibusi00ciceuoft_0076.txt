7 2 CICERO DE HNIBL'S 1.

libidinibus constringendos: to be held in fetters by their lusts.
For the use of the gerund and gerundivo. sce G. ἓξ 531-541.

tum . . . tum . . . tum: sometimes . . . sometimes . . . some-
times or at one time . . . at another . . . at another.

ξ 48. quod sentiant: which they happen to feel on each occasion
as it ha ens.

ρεψθξὶἲιηῒῇτ· suffer 01· endure through i. e. from beginning to end.

nee intemperantiam . temperantiamque: in English we should
join the negative to the veib, and have for the conjunctions both . . .
and (qve . . . que). After nee you would expect another nee, but
the construction is changed from the negative into an affirmative.

non quia . . . fugiat, sed quia . . . consequatur: after nan quia
we should regularly have the subjunct.; but after sed qaia wc should
expect the indic. See G. ἐξ 487, 488.

XV. ξ 49. fortitudinis ε few-titudo (ἀνδρεία) is the third Cardinal
Virtue. See ¹ 47.

ratio : pridciple, method, reasoning. viz.. that courage is not
desirable for itseff, but because of the pleasure that it brings.

† assiduitas z some MSS. read a.s·.s=1·dvitate.<·. but this is probably a
mistake caused by confusion with the pl. fissiliae.

perdiderunt: per in composition=through‚ thoroughly, eff. pet·-
petior, peraqo ,· but it has also a bad sense of coming to an end, (κῃ.
perdo, pereo. Pereo is the passive of perdo, in the same way as veneo
(venum eo), to be sold, is the passive of venda (venum do), to sell.

in eadem causa. · in the same condition 01· po sition.

qua: we might expect in qva, but the repetition of the preposition
is often dispensed with in cases of this kind.

mediocrium. se. dolorum. Of moderate pains we are masters. i. e.
we have control over moderate pains.

si minus : if not· ‚ minus here differs little if at all from non.
Sometimes minvs before a verb or adj. is not as strong as arzon.

e vita: the Epicureans and Stoics looked on suicide with lenient
or favourable eyes. Nowadays it is looked upon as a crime ; at
Rome, during the early part of the Empire and the latter part of the
Republic‚ it was regarded almost as a virtue. Plato allowed it in
case of terrible calamity ; Aristotle regarded it as a desertion of the
post allotted by the State.

theatro: this simile is supposed not to be original, but. to have
lucen quoted from Democritus. We are at once reminded of
Shakespeare's “All the world's a stage.”

suo nomine: lit. in their own name, i.e. on their own account.

XVI. ξ 50. J ustitia : the fourth of the four Cardinal virtues.

† impertit : has been conjectured in order to supply a verb which
seems to have been omitted in the MSS. Madvig reads affert, which
makes a similar meaning to impertit, and is equally good. Boeckel
reads sed eontra semper saei& fidem, altering the aliquid of the MSS.
into facit fidem, and quotes a similar passage from De Officiis, H.
