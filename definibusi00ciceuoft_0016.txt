12 CICERO DE FINIBUS 1.

ἓ 3. sourcesof the Treatise.—The authority on the subject-
matter of Book Ι. is Diogenes Laertius’ account of Epicurus.
(Diogenes Laertius lived about the second century A.D., and
wrote a history of philosophy in ten books, the last of which
deals with Epicurus and his philosophy at some considerable
length.) Cicero himself may have made use of: (1) Epicurus’
Epistle to Menoeceus 3 (2) his περὶ κυριῶν &ogau—some pas-
sages in the De Finibus are translated almost word for word
from these Greek originals 3 and (3) the lectures of Phaedrus
and Zeno, which he had himself attended <Book L, ἕ 16·and
note). The authorities for the other four books of the De
Finibus are: (1) Chrysippus περὶ τοῦ καλοῦ καὶ τῆς ἡδονῆς;
(2) the writings and oral communications of Posidonius3
(3) Chrysippus περὶ τελῶν 3 (4) Carneades ; (5) Aristotle,
Theophrastus, and Antiochus of Ascalon 5 and (6) Diodotus,
(For these names see Biographical Appendix.) In Book I.
of the De Finibus there is no allusion—no pointed allusion
at least—to Aristotle's E thies. Yet Cicero can scarcely
have been ignorant of the two dissertations on ἡδονή in
Books VII. and X.‚ or of friendship in Books VIII. and IX.‚
of the Nicomaelzecm Etlm'cs. It seems strange, too, that
Cicero should make no direct reference to Plato's views on
ἡδονή in the Republic, the Philebus, or elsewhere. It may
be noted here that the latter looked with disfavour on
pleasure, both because it seems to have no natural limits,
and because it consists in a transition from one state to
another, thus appearing to him to be unreal. Aristotle
took a more moderate view. Regarding pleasure as some-
thing “ which accompanies the activity of a natural faculty,’⁷
he thought it might be either good or bad, varying with the
faculty exercised. Cicero, however, hardly touches this
psychological side of pleasure.

ξ 4. Summary of Philosophy down to the time of Cicero.
—In order to understand the philosophie teaching of the
De Finibus, it is not necessary to go back farther than Plato
for our starting·point. It may be as well, however, just to
state that previous to Plato there were three main schools
of philosophy :—
