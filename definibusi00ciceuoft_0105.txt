or what does she decide upon as a test by which either to
aim at or avoid any thing? Nothing but pleasure and pain.

(31) “ Now, there are some of us who would like to handle
this subject with greater preciseness. These say that it is
not enough that the senses should judge what is good and
what is bad; they assert that by our mind also and reason
it can be understood both that pleasure is to be sought for
its own sake, and pain avoided for its own sake. And so
they say that there is within our minds this natural and

(33) “ Yet we both blame and think worthy of just dislike
all those who, enervated and corrupted by the allurements
of the pleasures of the moment, and blinded by desire, do
not foresee what pains and what troubles they will bring
on themselves, and commit the like fault with those who
