roi-quntum Titus Manlius Torquatus was consul Rc. 1⁴35, will·
Cneius Octavius. He was as austere as liis :incestor mentioned
above. and showed his severity in a similar fashion. His son,
Decimus Junius Silanus Manlianus, was accuscd of robbery and
o pressiori during his practomhip in B.C. 1⁸2, by thc inhabitants ..f

aoedonia, his province. Torquatus. at liis own roquos-t was entrusuwl,
with the investigation of the charges. and having found liis son
guilty, banished him froni his presence. Tlic son thereupon lianged
himself through grief, and thc unrclcnting father w0uld not even
attend his funeral.

consul: in nc. 165.

Gn. octavio: Cneius Octavius assistcd Aemilius Paullus in von-
quering Perseus, 167, and obtained the honour of a naval triumph in
that year. He was consul in 165 with Torquatus, and in 1⁴52 was
sent with two collcagues on an embassy to Syria, but was assassinated
in the gymnasium at Laodicea by a Syl-ian Greek named Leptines.

emancipaverat: it was not an uneommon event. for a person to be
adopted into another family. When this happened, the person took
the name of his new family and added the name of his former family,
the latter word being made to end in anus. Thus Manlius Torquatus,
when adopted by Decimus Junius Silanus, became Decimus Junins
Silanus stlavdianum the son of Aemilius Paullus. when adopted by
Publius Cornelius Scipio, became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus,
see G. §933. As long as the father lived a Roman son was in his
power (in potextate, ἰιι ἸηιαηηΥ patris). unless hc was emancipat-ed.
The strict meaning of emma-ipo (e manu capia) was to declaro a son
free from the patria potestus by the thrice-repcatcd aet of mam-istatia
and neamumissio.

Iaoodouum: Macedones, inhabitants of Macedonia, a district in
the north-east ot Greecc.

legatis accusantibus: the legates in this case complained to the
senate, who either investigated the matter themselves οι· referred it
to any judge they might select. By the Lea: Calpurnia. in B.c. 149,
a quaestio perpetua dc pecuniis mymtundix was instituted sor the
purpose of adjudicating upon cases of this kind.

pecunias cepisse : had taken money, im. had been bribed.

eausam dicore: the regular phrase for “ to defend onc's self.'’

ut omittam pericula . . . veniamus: notice ilie change from the
sing. omittam to the pl. wammam Cicero alone is making the
former remarks: his two friends are to join him in tlie later discussion.

525. huie Triario: it will be reuiembered that Cicero, Torquatus,
and Triarius are carrying on this discussion in Cicero’s villa at Cumae.

lii-toriae: the sing. historia could have been used here, but the pl.
is found, perhaps because attracted by litterae, or else because the
various parts οι· books of a history are each regarded as a history.

evolutio : this word is a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, ize. is used once here, and
nowhere else; but cf. in puetis evolvendis in ξ 72. The ancient
books were written on rolls of papyrus ιιι· parchment, which it was
necessary to umoll for the purpose of reading.
