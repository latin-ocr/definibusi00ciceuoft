of all the things that wisdom has furnished towards living
happily«¹ none is greater than friendship, none is more
fruitful, none more pleasant. And this he showed forth
not only in speech, but to a still greater extent in his life,
doingS, and habits. How great a thing friendship is, the
mythical tales of the ancients declare, in the large and
varied collection of which, tracked buck to the farthest
' antiquity, scarce three pairs of friends are found, though
you should start with Theseus and go down to Orestes.
Yet Epicurus in his own home, and that a small one, had
great crowds of friends agreeing together in all the harmony
of love. And this practice is now kept up by Epicureans.
But let us return to ‘che point : we need not speak of men.

in three ways. Some maintained that those pleasures which
related to friends should not be sought for their own sake]
so keenly as we seek our own. And though the stability of
friendship seems to some to totter when this position is taken

to follow and to come. But because we can in no wise keep
(up a sure and lasting pleasantness of life without friendship,
and because we cannot preserve that friendship unless we
esteem our friends as much as ourselves‚ for that very
reason this last is brought about in friendsffip, and friend-
ship is bound up with pleasure. For we both rejoice in the
joys of our friends as much as in our own, and feel pain
equally at their sorrows. (68) A wise man, therefore, will be
