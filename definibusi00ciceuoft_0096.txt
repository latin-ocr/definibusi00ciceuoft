Lucilius, fearing their criticism, says, “ Ι 0111 writing for
the men of Tarentum, Consentia, and Sicily.'' He was
speaking in jest, as usual 3 but the people for whose criticism
he was to polish his work were not so learned then, and his
writings are rather light, so that the highest refinement,
but only moderate learning, appears in them.

(8) But as for me, what reader am Ι to fear when Ι 0111
venturing to address you who are not inferior in philosophy
even to the Greeks? And yet Ι do this, indeed, challenged
by yourself in that delightful book which you sent me on
Virtue. But I suppose it happens to some that they recoil
from Latin writings because they have chanced upon certain
uncouth and wretched 11011510110115 fiom bad Greek into
worse Latin. Ι agiee with 1110111,Ρ1·011(10(1 only that they
think that not ev en the ‘G1eek 01 lerinals concerning the same
subjects should be lead. But who would not read good sub-

unless he be a man that wishes to be called “a perfect

and Tritannius, centurions, renowned men and chiefs and
standard-bearers. Therefore, 05 you have preferred, Ι,
1110 praetor at Athens, salute you in Greek when you
come to me. Ι say, (Χαῖρε Τ11115.’ Τ110 1101015 and the
whole squadron and band say, (Χαῖρε Titus! For this
reason Albucius is my foe, for this reason he is my
enem .''

(lg) And Mucius (Scaevola) rightly laughed at him.
But Ι 00111101 help wondering whence comes this haughty
disdain for our native products. This is not quite 1110 place
10 give a 100111103 but Ι feel, and Ι have often so argued,
that not only 15 1110 Latin language 1101 poor, as they would
commonly think, but 15 even richer than the Greek. For
