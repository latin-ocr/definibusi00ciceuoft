he does not allow past pleasures to pass away, but rvjoices

the other side set some one worn out with mental and
bodily pains as great as can overwhelui a man, with no
hope before him that things will ever be any uas-ier, and
moreover with no present or expected pleasures ; what
could be said or imagined more miserable than that ’.2 But
if a life crowded with pains is, above all things, to be
avoided, obviously the highest evil is to live with pain ; and
it is quite in harmony with that opinion that to live with
pleasure is the extreme good. For our mind lias· nowhere
to halt as at a goal, but all fears and anxieties are referred
to pain3 nor is there beyond this any thing which of its
own nature can annoy or oppress us. (42) Moreover, the
beginning of desii-ing and avoiding things, and of the
conduct of life, generally arise either out of pleasure or
out of pain. This being so, it is manifest that all right
and estimable things are referred to the possibility of living
with pleasure. But that is the highest, ultimate, οι·
extreme good— the Greeks call it *re'Aoe—which is itself
referred to nothing, whilst to it everything is referred. It
must, therefore, bo allowed that the highest good is to live
pleasurably.

XIII. “ Those who put the highest good in virtue alone
and, taken with the brilliancy of a word, fail to understand
what nature demands, will be released from a very great
error if they will only listen to Epicurus. Who would think
those excellent and fair virtues of yours either praise-
worthy or desirable unless they caused pleasureZ For just
as men think highly of the doctor’s skill, not for the sake of
the art itself, but for the sake of the good health it brings ;
just as the steersman’s art is praised because it compi-isos
the principles of right navigation, for its usefulness and
not for its art3 so wisdom, which is to be regarded as the
art of living, would not be sought after if it effected

othing. As it is, it is sought after because it is, so to
k, the workman for searching out and collectim„r
leasure. (43) (You now see what Ῐ mean by plcaww,
