Ennii: Q. Ennius, the Roman poet, horu at Rudiae 111 Calabria,
B.C. 239, died B.C. 169. He was a close friend of Scipio Africanus
Major. He wrote in hexameters eighteen books of Annals of Roman
History, and also many tragedies from Greek models, and comedies
and saturae. Virgil constantly echoes him.

Pacuvii : M. Pacuvius, nephew to Ennius, and the most ‘⁴ learned '⁵
of Roman tragic poets, was born at Brundusium B.C. 220, and died
B.C. 132. He wrote twelve tragedies and one praeteoeta. Of the
former the two most renowned were the ‘⁴ Dulorestes'' and “Antiopa,”
taken from Greek writers; but they contained much original and
independent work, and were not mere translations. The ‘⁴ Antiopa ’⁹
has for its subject the strife of Antiopa’s twin sons Zethus and
Amphion.

Euripidis: Euripides, the “most tragic '’ of the poets of Greece,
was born B.C. 480, and died B.C. 406. Among his tragedies he wrote
about Antiope, and also about Medea (the daughter of Ae'tes, king of
Colchis), who took vengeance on her faithless husband Jason by
killing his and her own two children, and also by murdering his new
wife. The “Antiopa '³ is lost ; the “ Medea '' survives, with4eighteen
others.

§ynephebos Caecilii: Caecilius Statius (B.C. 219-166 Ἰ), a Roman
eomic poet, by birth an Insubrian Gaul, was brought as a slave to
Rome. His many plays, among them the ‘⁶ Synephebi '² (the fellow—
youths), were for the most part imitations of Menander. “Vincere
Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte‚'' was, according to Horace, a
stock criticism.

Andriam Terentii: for P. Terentius Afer, see supra, §3. The

Menandri: Menander of Athens was the most distinguished poet
of the New Comedy3 he was born B.C. 342, and died B.C. 291. He
wrote over a hundred plays, of which only small fiagments remain ;
but we can obtain a fair idea of what they were like by the imitations
of Terence and Caecilius.
