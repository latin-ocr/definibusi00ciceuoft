nores, xv1. 51. 73

ix. 34. ‘⁴ Harum igitur duarum ndfidem sat-leudam justitia pollet.vv
Τὴε aliquid or alit quid of the MSS. might, according to him, easily
have been a copyist's mistake for acic id asae-it fidem.

oum sua vi: eum here is not a proposition but a conjunction.
eum . . . tum being ·= not only . . . but also.

defuturum: the noun ⁸11⁶» like the verb teperet, is often followed by
the future infin. ; cp. ξ 41.

non depravata ε not depraved by idle vain desires or appetites.

† ot quom admodum: the et is deficient in the Mss., but might
easily have dropped out in consequence of the copyist's mistake
arising troni the termination ct ot desideret.

mbullafftnqw sunt : these two words are possibly an unnecessary
inte 'on.

tizpioniprobitas si: the improbitas xz· is wanting in the MSS„ but
is an excellent conjecture by Madvig. Unless improbitas· or some
such word were supplied there would be no subject to turbulenta ext.
Imp-obitas is a better conjecture than irtjustesstiu, as Cicero makes
temeritas not imprudentia the opposite of prudentia, and libido not
intemperantia the opposite of temperantia ,· so impr-abitas rather
than injmtitia would be the opposite of justitia.

hoe ipso quod adest : by the very fact of its presence.

turbulenta ost ε the MSS. read et.

molita : πλε. molita from molior, not molitu. from molo.

quamvis: quamvis in Cicero is either followed by the subjunct., or
is used in connection with an adjective. In later writers and in the
Ξξξὲῃὲἴαῖἔέέέιέῗῃῗῖἷ ῗξὲ {satamssgssst'ffiffisskff&¹225ssssss
two moods. See G. ξξ 502, 503.

index: a pmof, informer, witness. There is anot-her reading
iudex (i.e. judeoe), judge ; but index is the better. Vindex, the
punisher or avenger, has also been suggested.

multi: aq. Quintus Curius, who was an accompliee in Catiline’s
conspiracy ; he betrayed the secret to his mistress Fulvia, who in
her turn communicated it to Cicero.

te consulo : Cicero was consul in B.c. 63, in which year he suc-
cessfully defeated the conspiracy of Catiline.

indicaverunt: some MSS. read judicaverunt, but the nonsense this
reading makes is perhaps a proof that inde-z is the preferable read-
inu} abovg. · {ude-z· and judico are much more common words than
-ι eoe an w wo.

ξ 51. deorum tamen horrent: 80. conscientiam.. They are afraid of
¹tleile consciousness of the gods; they are ahaid lest the gods should

ow.

“noete-que diesque '’: this is a poetical quotation either from
Ennius, and quoted by Cicero in De Senem„ 1. i., or it is Cicero's
translation of a verse from Aratus :

‘⁴ Cum caeloque simul noctesque diesque feruntur.'’
The collocation noctesque diesque is not found in Cicero‘s prose, but
