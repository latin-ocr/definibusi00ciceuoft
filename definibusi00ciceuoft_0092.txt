zeno (ξ 16) &was born at Citium inCyprus, and came to Atheus
in 299 ΒΩ. After attaching himself successively to the Cynics,
Megarios, and Academica, he eventually opened a school of his own
in a porch (στοά) adorned with paintings by Polygnotus. His
followers were on this account called STOICS : amongst them were
Chrysippus (ξ 6) and the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. As regards
his natural philosophy, there was a primary matter which was never
increased or decreased in amount. According to him virtue was the
supreme good, and only by means of virtue could man be happy.
Temperance and sels-denial were to be rigidly practised. He looked
upon the deity sometimes as “ unconditional necessity‚” sometimes as
the law of nature which accomplished what was right and prevented
the opposite. He is thought to have been ot* Phoenician extraction,
and his severe moral earnestness has been put down to this Semitic
strain. The Romans were much more in sympathy with this than
with the pure intellectualism of the main body of Greek thought;
with them the chief Stoic formula was “ convenienter natm-ae vivere.''
