those topics, which compi-ise the whole of life, be neglected2
For although the former are more popular, the latter at
any rate are more fruitful. This question, however, those
who read this work shall be allowed to decide. But I
think that this whole enquiry concerning the limits of good
and evil has been explained pretty fully by me in that book
in which Ι worked out, as far as I could, not only the
doctrine Ι approved of, but also that which was held by
each separate school of philosophy.

V. (13) To begin with the easiest, let the theory of
Epicurus, which is very well known by most people, come
first before us. You will see that I shall explain it with no
less care than that with which it is usually expounded by
those very people who approve of that school. For I want
to discover the truth, not 10 refute some one as if he were an
opponent. The opinion of Epicurus about pleasure was once
defended in detail by L. Torquatus, a man skilled in every
branch of learning, and I answered him, when G. Triarius,
a young man of especial gravity and learning, was present
at that discussion. (14) For as both had come to me at
my estate in Cumae to pay their respects, first of all we had
a few words among ourselves on literature, about which
both possessed the greatest enthusiasm 3 then Torquatus
said, “ Since we have at last found you at leisure, Ι will, at
any rate, hear why it is that you, I will not say hate our
Epicurus as those who disagree with him generally do, but
at least do not approve of the man who, as Ι think, alone
saw the truth, and freed men’s minds from the greatest
mistakeS, and bequeathed to us everything that might bear
on living a good and happy life. But I consider that you,
like our friend Triarius, are the less pleased with him
because he has neglected those elegances of language which
are found in Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus. For Ι can
scarcely be led so far as to believe that his sentiments
should seem to you not to be true.'’

(15) “ See how much you are mistaken, Torquatus,’' said
I. “ Τ110 language of that philosopher gives 1110 no offence,
for he grasps his meaning in words, and ¹speaks plainly that
which I may understand 3 and yet, if a philosopher were 1ο
