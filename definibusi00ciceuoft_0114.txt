22 CICERO DE F1N1Brs 1.

XV ΙΙ. (55>“ Ι will explain 1n a few words what are the
00101131103 of this sure and 00113111 opinion. There is no
uncertainty as to the actual limits of good and of evil, that
13, 33 to pleasure and pain3 but men go wrong regarding
1110111 when they do not know whence pleasme and pain
arise. Now we confess that the pleasurse and pains of the
mind are born of the pleasures and pains of the body.
Thus I allow what you were saying just now, that those of
us fail in their case who think differently 3 and they are, as Ι
300, many, but only half-taught. And we confess that, though
mental pleasure brings us joy, and mental pain brings us
trouble, yet each of these is sprung from the body and is
traced back to the body 3 and that, none the less, the plea-
sures and pains of the mind are much greater than those of
the body. For with the body we can feel nothing but what
is present and with us 3 with the mind we can feel what is
past and what is 10 come. For though we feel pain equally
in mind when we feel pain in the body, yet there can be a
great increase of our pain if we fancy that any long and
lasting 111 hangs over us. And this we can apply to pleasure
also 3 so that it is greater if we fear no such thing.

(56) “And now this much is clear: that the greatest

pain or the greatest grief of mind exerts more influence

upon a happy or a wretched life than either of them if it
be equally enduring in the body. We do not, however, hold
that, when pleasure is taken away, affliction at once succeeds,
unless pain have stepped into the place of pleasure. On the
contrary, we hold that in being free from pains we feel joy,
even though there follow no pleasure of a kind to stir the
sense 3 and thus can be realised how great a pleasure it is
10 feel no pain. (57) But just as we are elated by those
good things to which we look forward, so we are made
joyous by those which we recall to memory. The foolish are
tortured with the memory of ills 3 but the wise are rejoiced
by bygones renewed in pleasant memories. There is some-
thing in us whereby we sink what has gone against us in
everlasting oblivion, as it were, and retain a sweet and
pleasant recollection of what has gone well with us. But
when we scrutinise the past with a keen and searchjng
mind, sorrow follows if it be ill, joy if it be good.
