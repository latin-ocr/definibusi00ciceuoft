has but little power over him. Such a man enjoys more
pleasure from our limited life here than from an eternity
of life.

The art of clialectic, which treats of the meaning of words
and the mere sequence of argument, is comparatively un-
important: but natural philosophy—by which the nature
of all things is known, by which sear, superstition and
ignorance are dissipated, and by which our morals are
improved—is, on the other hand, of the greatest import-

possibility of anything being known by the senses, deny
the possibility of all knowledge, and so cannot know that
nothing can be known.

The study of natural philosophy produces courage, tran-
quillity of mind, temperance and the power of distinguishing
truth from falsehood.

as towards himself.

(2) That the first desire to establish intimacy arises
from 3 desire of pleasure, but such great affection is
ripened that afterwards friendship is desired for its own
sake, without any idea of advantage or pleasure.

(3) That wise men agree not to love their friend laes
than themselves. This obviously causes people to live
