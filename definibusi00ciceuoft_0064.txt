higher and more important cause to discover than the material, yet
both Democritus and Epicurus have neglected the former. The
Academics and Perspateties, on the other hand, distinguish between
the Material and Efficient causes.

illae Epicuri propriae ruinae: illae = the following. ruinae == the
eri-ors and faults which cause the destruction of Epicurus’ fabric of
philosophy.

deorsum ε 01· dvarsnx, from (le and rar-snm or rtrrxnx=turned down,
=d0w11wards, down. The use οἵ· this word seems rather strange,
when 11ἰι are told just before (ξ 17) that ·‘ there is no highest and no
lowest? nee summum nee infimum.

deinde ibidem z there is no primum expressed to correspond to the
deinde, but it is understood after vens-et. ibidem, lit. “in the same
place '³ Ξ in his course of argument.

occurreret: this metaphorical use of ‹›et·117·7·‹›=to occur, to come
into one's mind⁷ is very common.

e regione: there are two important meanings of this adverbial
phrase: (1) ‘⁴ in 3 straight line‚'‘ *⁴ directly ’² (the meaning here) ; and
(2) “ 111 the opposite direction‚'' over against,«opposite. Ad lineam is
a synonym for, and explanatory of, e remane.

† itaque attulit rem commenticiam: these words· are probably an
interpolation from the marginal note of some reader.

declinare, ete.: Cicero's objection seems very reasonable. If all

he atonis are borne downwards by their own weight in a straight
line. and no assertion is made that any of the atoms are larger or
move more quickly than the others, it necessarily follows that no
atoni will overtake or combine with another. To get out of this
difficulty, Epicurus alters his original theory that all the atonis
move down in 3 straight line, and asserts that, for some unexplained
reason, a certain number diverge and move horizontally or slantingly,
and thus meet other atoms that are moving in vertical and slanting
ireetions.

ex quo efficeretur : the infin. (ςῖΫίσὶ could have been employed, but
the subjunctive (which expresses a purpose or result) is used here
because 311 effici precedes,

quo . . . quam fieri, etc.: qnam ji1¹1·i‚ete.‚ explains the qun. We
have here the two constructions after a comparative: (l) the abl„
and (2)( gnata, with an appropriate case. Phqssieo is the dat.

ξ 20. si omnes atomi declinabunt: Cicero is not altogether fair
in his argument. Epicurus is not bound to say that all the atoms
move shntingly, and even if they did, there is no reason why they
should move in parallel directions, so that a certain number would
inevitably meet.

sive : or if, unt whether.

suo nutu: ‘nutu-3 z (l) a nodding or nod, and hence (2) = will ;
and 8210 nvt‘u here: of its own will or accord, without any external
force. Nutufie is also said to mean (3) adownward tendency or force,
