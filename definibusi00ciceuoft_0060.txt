56 CICERO DE FlNlssus 1.

accedis saluto omnis cohorsque : notice that in aceedis and omnis
the final ,ς 18 80 slightly pronounced as to be practically omitted for
the purposes of scansion. These lines, little as they look it, are
hexameters; maluisti is a trisyllable‚ the 11 being regarded as a
consonantal 1. The scansion of

 

id quod Ι maluisti te Ι cum ad me acfcedi‘s' sa'l Ι EtE

is very harsh; but this harshness is not surprising in a poet so
ancient as Lucilius. The contractiori of milti to mi, and its elision
before the A of Albucius, and the quadrisyllable inimicus at the end
of a hexameter, are also harsh.

χαῖρε : the Greek word for the Latin salt-e.

ξ 10. Mucius: ie. Scaevola.

† satis: this word satis· has been supplied by conjecture, as it is
necessary for the sense, though wanting in the MSS. Perhaps a better
reading is 11011 mirari non queo. the first non having been omitted 111
copying, because of the non which follows before queo. Cf. note on
non imment, infra. There is a conjecture rimari = to examine, find
out, instead of mira-ri. With this reading there is no need for the
insertion of either 11011 01· satis.

domesticarum : belonging to one's house, home, country, or nation.

-ξ- non inopem: the non is here required by the sense, though
omitted in the MSS. So frequent is this omission that a pupil is
sometimes told that non modo must often be translated as non modo
non. It is not at all certain that Cicero is justified in his boast that
Latin has as full, expressive, and fertile a vocabulary as Greek.

quando: quando (not quum) must be always used for the direct
interrogative when, ?

vel dicam: or shall I rather say. This phrase corrects, qualifies,
or amplifies a previous expression ; nobis of course z Cicero.

E* forensibus operis : seems to cover Cicero’s work, both as a politieian
and a pleader. Elsewhere he distinguishes between work done as
orator and ’111 furo—the latter place being now mostly used for
purposes of law and finance.

ἨΞ praesidium : my post. This refers to a saying of Pythagoras,
that a man must not desert his post unless ordered to do 80 by his
general, isse.. God.

in eo . . . ut = to the end that, wsith a view t0; lit. = 111 the
Obheecgitihlffient: this depends 011 the ⁴modo before legant, provided
they read those Greek authors, and do not merely pretend to read
&figlint . . . desiderent: the subjunctives expressing a class after
‘bgqlllls nemini: in Cicero the dative of the agent (instead ot* ab with
the abl.) is, for the most part, only used after the past participle
passive: see G. §2939 and note 011 tibi probatus above in§2. As
regards the number of his works, Cicero at that time was certainly
