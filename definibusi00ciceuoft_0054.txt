ξ 1. Brute: Marcus Junius Brutus (by adoption, Q. Servilius Caepio)
was born B.c. 85. He made Marcus Porcius Cato his great political
model. In 49 he followed Cato, took the side of l’ompcy, and
opposed Caesar; but in 48 he was reconciled to Caesar, aud became
one of his adherents. In this year Cicero made him one of the
speakers in his treatise BJ-utvs,x1·1·e (lo claris Orutnrisbm ; and in
46 he dedicated to him his Orator. and later this treatise, De
Finibns; and, two years later, the Tusculan Disputatinn-s‘ and De
Vatum Deorum. In B.C 44 Brutus joined Cassius and the other
