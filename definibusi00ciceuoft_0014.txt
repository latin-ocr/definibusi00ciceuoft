10 mcmzo DE F1>11Bus 1.

the De Divinatione (on the subject whether gods commum-
cate with men by means of augury, ete), the lle Senectute,
the Dc Amicitia, the De Fato (an account of Fate and
Freewill), the Paraclooeci (an account of certain paradoxical
opinions of the Stoics), the De Officiis (a treatise on Duty), ,
and the De Finibus, on the Highest Good.

So far we have dealt with Cicero’s speeches and philo-
sophical works. In addition to these must be mentioned
(1) his Letters, of which he wrote a vast number, and
of which more than 800 are preserved, (2) his poetical
works, which were very poor in quality though not small
in quantity—his chief poem was written on the sub-
ject of his consulship3 and (3) his historica] and mis-
cellaneous works, eff. a prose account of his consulship,
an account of his policy immediately previous to his
consulship, etc.

ξ 2. The De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, a discussion,
in five books, on the subject of the limits of good and evil,
is one of the most polished md elaborated of Cicero’s
philosophica] w.01ks The discussion is in the form of
dialogues between Cicero and vaiious friends, but the
dialogues are not all supposed to take place at the same
time, and, while Cicero takes a chief part in all of them,
care is taken that the other interlocutors are dead at the
time when Cicero published the treatise, which was probably
in August, 45.

Since meeting Caesar on his return from the East in
Β. 0. 47, he had been on good terms with him, and had been
able to use his influence on behalf of friends, but, though
admning Caes ·a1 ’5 magnanimity, he would not take part
with him. He endeavomed to find consolation for the ruin
of his old party and for his own family troubles (6.9. the
divorce from his first wife Terentia and the death of his
daughter Tullia) in social intercourse and in literary
labouls. Of their many fruits (see foot of page 9), the
De Finibus 15 one of the best.

The scene of Books I. and ΙΙ. 15 laid at Cicero's viHa in
Cumae in the year 50 Β. 0., the speakers being Cicero, C.
Valerius Triarius, and L. Manlius TorquatuS, pra'ptor elect.
