who treated his son with such sternness that when the
Macedonian envoys accuses] the 8011 whom he had taken
over from D. Silanus and adopted, because they alleged
that as praetor he had taken bribes in his province, he
ordered him to plead his cause before himself? Having
heard both sides 01 the case, he declared that 1118 son did
not seem to have proved himself such as his fathers had
been when in command, and forbade him to come into
his presence. Do you think that T. Torquatus took his
pleasures into consideration? To omit, however, the perils,
toils, and even pain which every good man takes upon him
for his country and his friends, so that he not only grasps
at no pleasure, but rather passes them all by—-prefers, in
fact, to face any 1161118 whatever rather than neglect any
part of his duty—-let 118 proceed to things which, light

doctrines. And as to the question which is often asked—
why so many people are Epicureans—there are many other
reasons 3 but this 0116 1168 the greatest attraction for the
multitude: they think it was said by him that to do for
theirown sakes the things which are lawful and right is a joy,
that is, a pleasure. The most estimable fail to understand
that the argument is turned upside down if this be the
case. For if it be granted, even though nothing be referred
to the body, that what Ι mentioned are of and in themselves
pleasant, it follows 'that virtue and knowledge of events must
be sought for their own sakes. This Epicurus is far from
desii-ing. (26) These, then, Ι repeat, are the teachings of
Epicurus which Ι reject. For the rest, I would for my
part he had either been more versed 111 learning (for he is,
