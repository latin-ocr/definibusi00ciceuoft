78 CICERO DE FINIBUS 1.

his philosophy was to remove superstition and excessive sear of the
gods. See supra, ξ 41. Epicurus held that the gods lived in blessed
tranquillity. and did not trouble themselves about the affairs of men,
who consequently had no need to fear thc gods.

sit z conditional subjunct. following mim-are.

de vita ε miyro is sometimes followed by de, and sometimes by eoe
or e.

instructus: instruo = (1) to pile up, erect; (2) to set in array
(of armies) : (3) to prepare, furnish. Ins-tructus can very seldom be
translated by instrvez‘ed, and then only in connection with such
words as doctriua, studia, artes, etc. Be careful not to translate such
words as officium, securus, obtineo, by their English cognates, unless
you obtain sufficient verification. Thus these words respectively
mean ‘⁴ duty‚’' “free from care‚''' and ·'· keep possession of.''

grate : qrata animun =with pleased and grateful mind, with pleasure.

praesentibus: this abl. after potim- is said to be the abl. of com-
parison implied in the verb, the literal meaning of which is to be
more able, to be better, master of; hence to posses-5³. See G. ξ 15,
Obs. 1.

si qui incurrunt: the que· here stands for aliqui, since after ne,
nisi, num and Si, quvis is used for aliquis.

plus habeat: ‘⁴ have more reason ;” se. causae, partitive gen. de-
pending on plu-Q· and take quud as a conjunction = that, approxi—
mating closely in use to eur. Another way of ‘taking the passage is
to regard plus as an ordinary accusative, and the quod before qaudeat
and an‘qatm· as an accus. of respect and referring back to plns.

ξ 63. Epicurus : saseeit or derit.

exiguam dixit fortunam : the adjective eoez‘yuam is here to be
taken as part of the predicate, and is almost equivalent to an adverb :
“fortune intervenes to a slight extent,’' vle. seldom.

percipiatur, . . . videamus: notice the present tenses, although
in Or. Obz. governed by the past davit. It is true that some MSS.
give dicit, but all the better MSS. read dixit. These presents must
either be regarded as an irregularity or else as historie tenses. -

vestra ι refers to the Stoics‚ whose doctrines Cicero expounds later
on, and to the Aeademics, both of whom prided themselves on their
dialectic. The Epicureans, on the other hand, regarded dialectic
and logie as superfluous. See ξ 22.

nullam z this is followed by nec· . . . nee, which emphasise and do
not remove the negative idea.

vim z nearly all the early editions, and also Morelius and Holstein,
read vim, but the two chief MS S. read riam. The emendation seems
preferable, since, although we can say ‘² dialectic shows the way to
. . .,’² it is straining language to write ‘⁴ in the art of dialectic there
is a way to a better life.⁷'

in physicis z see ξ 17, ‘⁵ in physicis. quibus maxime gloriatur.''

ea scientia: refers not to in phy-vicis, but to dileetc'ea, and: in
seientia hujus rei (ἵζε. dileetieae). Boeckel, however, says ea seientia
refers to physica or natural philosophy.
