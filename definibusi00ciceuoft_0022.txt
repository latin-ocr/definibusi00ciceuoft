as when all pain is removed. This latter form of pleasure
is the greatest of all pleasures. There 13110 intermediate
state between pleasure and pain 3 what people call the
intermediate state, zze. when man is free from every sort of
pain, is really the state of the highest pleasure.

ΟΗΑΡ. XII.—One proof that pleasure is the highest
good and pain the chief evil can be seen in the
example of a man who is enjoying great uninterrupted
pleasures, both mental and bodily, without any prospect or

CHAP. §iv—so, too, (c) couraqe is cultivated not for

annoyance. The lofty mind has no fea-r of death, as by
means thereos it can free itself at any moment from pain.
Cowardice is avoided as the parent of pain, and courage
desired as the author of pleasure.
