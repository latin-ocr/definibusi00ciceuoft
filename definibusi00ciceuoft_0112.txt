20 CICERO DE FINIBUS 1.

and by reason of that frailty of mind many have utterly
ruined parents, many their friends, some their country, and
very many themselves 3 so, on the other hand, a strong and
lofty mind is free from all care and worry when it both
despises death—those who are perturbed by death are in
like case as they were before their birth—and is so prepared
for pains that it remembers that even the greatest pains are
ended by death, and that the small ones have many intervals
of ease3 while of moderate pains we are masters, so that we
bear them if they are beai-able, and, if not, we calmly pass

cowardice always torture the mind, and always vex it, and
are harassing, so too wickedness, by the very fact of its
presence, is harassing to him in whose mind it takes up its
quarters3 and if it has achieved anything, however secretly
it has done it, it never feels sure that its deed will always
be hidden. On the deeds of the wicked, for the most part,
comes first suspicion, then common talk and rumour, then
the accuser, then the witness; yes, and many too, as in your
own consulship, Cicero, have given witness against them-
selves. (51) Even those who seem to themselves well·
enough hedged in and guarded from the knowledge of man,
dread the knowledge of God, and look on those very anxietieS,
