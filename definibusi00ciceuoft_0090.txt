Epicurei, the followers of Epicurus; see Epicurus.

Epicurus (passim) z a celebrated philosopher, born at Samos 342 ΒΩ.
After extensive travels he went to Athens in 306, and established
himself there, and taught in a garden; hence his followers were
called The Philo-sophan Qf tlte Gar-den. All the other heads of
schools‚ eff. Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, had gone through a long pre-
vious training, but Epicurus was sels—taught, and to a large extent
despised learning (Cicero often—eff. §§ 26, TZ-taunts him on
account of his ignorance). His ethica] system was the same aS, or
rather a development of, the Cyrenaic, and made pleasure the chief
good; but- by making a distinction between higher and lower plea-
sures (ey. in §§ 55-57) he obviously introduced a standard other than
pleasme by which to judge ot conduct. Modern Hedonism has
passed through a similar stage, in procecding from Hobbes to QS.
Mill, thus sacrificing logical consistency to morality. Epicurus
adopted two other modifications, mutually dependent on one another,
of Democritus ε his introduction of the clinamen (notes, ξ 19), and his
belief in free-will.

intimate acquaintance with Phaedrus, who continued from that time
until ΤΟ B.c. to be the head of the Epicurean School. In writing

his De Natura Deorum, Cicero obtained great assistance from the
works and lectures of Phaedrus.
