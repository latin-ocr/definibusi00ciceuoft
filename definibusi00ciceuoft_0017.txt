whole world to a single principle ( ‘⁴ Monists '’)‚ in‹·1uded
amongst its exponents Thales of Miletus (640-550 13.c.),
Anaximenes (circ. 570 1³13), and Heraclitus of Ephesus (cir.
513 Β.ο.), who respectively held that (1) water. (2) air,
(3) fire, was the single original element from which every-
thing was made and into which everything was turned.

Two later thinkers are sometimes attached to this school.
(1) Amaeaqoras of Clazomenae (499-427 Rc.) belongs to
this school3 but instead of looking—as his predecessors had
done——for any original element, from which without external
aid all things arose, he taught that everything in the world
was ordered and regulated by a divine mind or intelligent-e
(Νοῦς). (2) Empedocles (circ. Rc. 440) tried to put together
fragments of previous thought in a new way, and is conse-
quently called an “ eclectic.’' He held that from the action
of love and hate on the four primordia] elements—earth,
fire, air, water—all forms of life came by a sort of
evolution.

II. THE ELEATIC—to which is due the distinction
between the “ real ’' and ,the “phenomenal,” and between
perception (αἴσθησις) and thought (vofic)-—founded by Xeno-
phanes of Colophon (fl. 540-500 B.c.), who fled to Elea, or
Velia, a Greek colony on the west coast of Lucania, when
his native land was con quered by the Persians. He disliked
the current anthropomorphism‚ and held that the whole of
Nature was God; and this doctrine was developed by his
successors Parmenides and Zeno. Parmenides, a native of
Elea (fl. 460 B.c.)‚ seems to have settled in Athens and
become acquainted with Socrates. He insisted on the unity
of things (τὸ ἔν), but, unlike Xenophanes, did not envisage
it as God. Plato was largely influenced by him. Zeno of
Elea (not to be confounded with Zeno of Citium, the Stoic)
taught that all knowledge and all assertions were relative—
thus people say a peck of corn by falling to the ground
makes a noise, but a millionth part of a peck of corn makes
no noise by falling to the ground. These assertions are not
both absolutely true, but only relatively true. He is called
εὑρετὴς τῆς διαλεκτικῆς (Inventor of the Method of Inquiry).

III. THE ITA LIO, founded by Pythayoras, who was
born in Samos about 580 B.c., but lived mostly at Croton.
