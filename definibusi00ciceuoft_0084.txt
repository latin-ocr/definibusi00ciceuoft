XX. ξ 65. locus ς a topic. Cf. ξ 9, qum» quidem locvm.

nullam omnino-fore: Cf. De Amic.. IX. 32. Omnino, in the sense
of ‘⁴ at all ,” after a negative, is very common.

nihil esse majus : the whole of this chapter should be compared
with Cicero’s De Amicitia, which as the name implies deals with
the subject of friendship, and expresses Cicero's own views In this
book we have only the Epicurean view.

fictae veterum fabulae: Cicero makes a contmst between true
history andfietae fabulae, where scope was given to ancient writers
to invent instances of friendship.

tria vix amicorum paria: the three pairs are Theseus and Pirithoiis.
Achilles and Patroclus, Pylades and Orestes; thus in going from
Theseus to Orestes, you go from the beginning to the end. In the
De Amic„ IV. 15, he talks of *ri-1· tria aut quatuor paria, the fourth
pair being Damon and Phintias. In real history Epaminondas and
Pelopidas, Q. Fabius Maximus and P. Decius Mus (the second),
Scipio and Laelius, etc.

paria : par an adj.=equal; par (m.). subst.=comrade‚ companion3
and sm]- (n.). subst. = a pair.

Orestem: Orestes, son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra‚ slew his
mother because she had murdered her husband, his father. In order
to be purified from this murder he had to bring the statue of Artemis
to Greece from the Tauric Chersonese. In this expedition he was
accompanied by his friend Pylades.

mesen: Theseus, the great legendary hero of Attica, supposed to
have been king in the 13th century B.c., and to have united the
demes of Attica into one politica] whole, the chief city being Athens.
Pirithoiis helped him to carry off the famous Helen, and in return
Theseus joined him in his attempt to carry off Proserpine fiom the
lower regions.

una¹ in domo: Epicurus bequeathed his house and gardens to his
pupils, as a permanent place for studying his philosophy. This
house was in danger of being pulled down and the gardens built
upon in the time of Cicero ; but the danger was averted through the
mediation and liberality of the Epicurean teachers Phaedrus and
Patro. The Epicureans are often referred to as the philosophers of
the Garden (οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν κήπων), in the same way as the Stoics are the
philosophers of the Porch (στοά). ,

conspiratione : conspiratio = “ a breathing together ; ” hence
(1) harmony, concord ; and in a bad sense, (2) plotting, conspiracy.

greges: this word is sometimes used in an invidious sense, as a
flock or crowd of ruffians (desperatormn hominnm flaqitv'osi qreqes)‚
who, like sheep, blindly follow their leader in his crimes ; but osten,
as here, it is used in a good sense == a crowd, band. cf. philoco-
