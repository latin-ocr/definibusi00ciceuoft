plorum qreqes and stipa-ti qreqibux amic-aru m ,· and Horace describes
himself as “Epicuri de grege porcum.'’

§ 66. tribus: distinguish tribnx, the dat. or abl. of tm - three,
from tribus, -ιω, fem„ a tribe. Of the three viexvs, the first is given
here in alii cum . . . end of ξ 68; the second in §⁴ 69, amnt autrm,
qnidam. etc.-; and the thinl¹ in ξ 70, ,mut anetem qui. 'I‘hc first view,
viz. that we ought not to seek our friends’ pleasures with as much
eagerness as we seek our own,- is that of Epicurus himself; the
second and third are the views of later Epicure-ans.

ano-trin: i.e. the Epicuream, since Torquatus, who is speaking.
isan Epicurean.

per scipsas : τῖε. the pleasures of our friends purely as pleasures
to them, and not as pleasures to oui-selvo&

quo Ιοοο 1 by which position, ⁷20. by holding this theory.

meatur tamen: in the previous phrase there is an implied con-
cession : etsi or quanquam stabilitas amicitiae ridetur vaciblare.

de quibus ants : see §§ 43-54.

monet amicitias comparare: manea admits of the following con-
structions: (1) aliquem (Ze νει,- (2)› aliquem aliqnz'd; (3) vt, ne, or
{he simple subjunctive ; and (4) an object or relative clause. Accord—
'ng to the rule—

“ After axk, command, adri-w, and stra-e,
By ut translate infinitive ''—

weshould have expected ut with the subjunct. ; but instead we have
construction (4) ; “advises the procuring friendships‚'' comparare
being a kind of accus. after monet.

partis : partis, the perf. part. pass. of pario, to produce, obtain,
must be distinguished from parti-³, the genitive of pars, a part, and
from partis, the 2n‹l sing. ofpa1·t1‘0‚ I share.

ξ 67. despicationes : this word is only found in this passage.

tm amieis quam sibi: “to our friends in the same way as to
ourselves.” Notice tam . . . qnam, which approximates in meaning
to tum . . . quum = not only . . . but also.

sibi: the use of this word seems strange at first sight, since it does
not refer to the subject of the sentence, amicitiae, but to the personal
subject understood. This use is not uncommon with the pronouns sui,
eibi, w, and the pronominal adj. mus, both with and without ipse.

quodquia : quod closely joined to another particle, such as xi, nisi,
utinam, uhi, quiet. quoniam, etc„ is a continuative conjunction, and
always has reference to something which precedeS, and may be
translated by “ but‚” “ though,'’ etc.

tueri : tuem· = (l) to look at. behold ; and here (2) to look after,
protect. From the second meaning we get the adj. tutus and the
noun tutma

seque amieos st nosmet : ‘⁴ love our friends equally with ourselves ; ’'
the literal translation of the Latin words is ‘⁶ Love our 'friends
equally and ourselves (equally).‘’

hoe ipsum ε loving our friends as ourselves.
