30133, xx. 71, 72. 83

†⁸aepe evenire videmus ε all the MSS. read saepo enim videnum,
which makes no sense. Halm's conjecture evenire for enim. makes
good sense, and the change is not great. Boeckel, however, prefers
eve-nim. which makes almost better sense, and corresponds more
closely with '⁴ et saepe esse fcwtum '' in the similar passage, De Fen„
11. xxvi. 83.

rationem· reason or principle of friendship. institutionem : esta-
blishment‚ foundation.

5 71. usisibus . . testibus: for the Epicurean doctrine that the
senses were the only reliable guides to knowledge, see supr-,11 § 64.

idest: explanatory.

integris: ianteqet from ἱιι and ta1190—1it.unt0uched; '¹ hence
uninfluencetl, unbias sed; also unaduherated, uninjured, whole.

prosperum . . . asperum: the two contrasted words prosperum
and asperum are probably chosen for their similarity in sound.

comprehenderit: has here a combination of the two ideas of
·‘ understanding ’‘ and “seizing hold of.'’

deduceret: not the usual sequence of tenses after debemus . . .
comprehenderim but the main idea in the writer's mind is “he
grasped . . . in such a way that he led.”

parum eruditus ι cf. ξ 26, supra.

ς’ 72. in poetis evolvendis: cf. note on evolutio in ξ 25.

Plato: see Introduction.

si . . . conteret: conteret-e atium or trmpns suum is much more
common than canter-cre τι. Cf. Dc Amic„ XXVII. 104. in quibus
(studiis) remoti ab oculis populi omne otiosum tempus contrivimusl’

numeris, astris: it is not incorrect to say that Plato wasted his
time with numbers and the stars; but it is incorrect to say that they
started from false beginnings or hypotheses. A mention is made of
the science of music and science of geomet1y‚ so numeris and astris
are to be taken as the science of number, and the science of the stars
or astronomy.

quo jucundius: quo is primarily an instrumental abl„ and' 13 used
instead οἱ ut in “'final comparative sentences. See G. ξ 453.

633 ergo artes persequeretur: the ι '90 has a resumptive force, and
serves to show that the main sentence, which has been interrupted
by dependent clauses, is now continued. Persequeretur is parallel
to tempus emwunwret and se conteret, and not parallel with the other
subjunctives in the dependent clauses.

perinde: zze. equally fruitful as it is laborious.

non ergo: erqo here has its ordinary meaning and use, “therefore,”
‘⁴ accordingly, · '' it is connected with the Greek ἔργῳ.

inquit: it 13, perhaps, unnecessary to remind the reader that it
is Torquatus who has been speaking since chapter ix. §29‚ and
expounding the doctrines of Epicurus. He now wishes to hear

20611Ἱο3 ὦ1111013111, which is contained in the second book of thc
