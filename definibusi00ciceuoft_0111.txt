wisdom is to be sought fm- the plvnsures it brings, and fully
to be shunned for the patius it entails!

(47). “ In like manner we shall maintain that neither is
temporanee to be sought for its own sake, but because it
brings tranquillity to our minds, and calms and southa< them
with a kind of harmony. lt is temperance which warns us
to follow reason in seeking things or avoiding them. Not
that it is enough to decide what is to be done or not to be
done 3 we must also abide by our decision. But most
people, because they are unable to hold by, and adhere to,
what they have themselves resolved3 weakened and overcome
by the vision of pleasure which meets them, hand themselves
over to be bound by their lusts, and do not foresee what will
happen ; and therefore, for the sake of a pleasure which is
neither large nor necessary, which might be obtained per-
chance in some other way, and which they could even forego
without pain, they fall into dangerous diseases, losses, and
shame, and are often made liable to the punishments of the
laws and the law-courts. (48) But those who wish to enjoy
pleasures only on condition that no pains ensue on their
account ; those who abide by their judgment, so that they
may not be conquered by pleasure, and do that which they feel
they ought not to do—these, through passing pleasure by,
gain the greatest pleasure. These, also, often even suffer
pain, lest, if they do not do so, they should fall into greater
pain. Hence it follows that intemperance is not to be
avoided for its own sake, and that temperance is to be
sought‚ not because it avoids pleasures‚ but because it

attains greater ones.

XV. (49) There will be found the same explanation for
fortitude. The performance of tasks and the endurance of
pains are not in themselves attractive; nor are patience,
and application, and late working, and industry itself (much
praised though it is), and even fortitude. On the contrary,
