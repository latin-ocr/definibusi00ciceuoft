nores, xlx. 0⁴. 79

omnium nutem rerum natura. : by a knowledge of the nature of all
things we obtain four things, viz„ fri-edum from (l) superstition,
(2) sear of death, (3) ignorem-e, and (4) we obtain n better moral
character.

morati: 'ufir-atem, an adj. derived from *mmez* having certain
mannersss’ well-mannered‚ must be distinguished from ηιδιτιίηκ, the
participle of mbr-«w, 1 delay, and from nuh-atus, the participle of
ωῦνον, Ῑ am foolish.

didicerimm: notice the fut. perf. tense after the future rrimus,
where in English we use the present or perfect.

sumta illa . . . regula : this refels to the κανὼν οἱ Epis-urus. Cf.
De Nat. Dema, Ι. 43, Velleius says ··' ex illo coelesti Epicuri de
regula et judicio volumine,⁷' “from that divine seron of Epicurus on
the canon of judgment‚ and judgment.'’ περὶ κριτηρίου ἢ κανών.

omnium: it is very seldom that omnium = of all things3 but the
excuse for its employment here in the neuter with this meaning, is

- that we have a ret-um following close after, and omnium rernm, the

correct expression for ‘⁶ of all things,” would have sounded tautologous.

ξ 64. qui ni omnes veri erunt : cf. ,judicia rernm ‘in sensibus, etc„
ξ quos qni tollunt ε quos refers to seusnx, but is an abbreviated

The people referred to asgqui tollunt sensus are thg?lefenders of the
New Academy, who said we could never attain to truth, but only to
probability, and that the senses and understanding were both liable
to error.

ii : the MSS. read Ῐιὶ, which is justified by Boeckel because definite
people, the Academias, are alluded to. ¹ ι

probability only is attainable ; all they can say is that it is probable
that probability only is attainable.

metum religionis : is here used very much in the sense of snper-
sationis metum. The word reliq io is either derived from νεὶέμνο, to
read or consider agaim or more probably from reliam-e, to bind
again, and hence approximating in meaning to obli-quein. It means
(1) reverence for ‘God‚ piety inward and outward (zle. manifested by
ceremonies and rites); (2) religious seruples‚ religious awe3 (3) a

rerum occultarum: things hidden and zrqnyssterious iri the earth, air
and heaven. The genitive depends on issam-aticum.

natura: abl. abs. with eoeple'eata understood. In the abl. abs.
construction, when the nouus are joined together by-que or et, the
participle may be put in the plural, although some or all of the
nouns are in the singular.

† ab eodem ina : endem = Epicurus, who has been J'ust mentioned
