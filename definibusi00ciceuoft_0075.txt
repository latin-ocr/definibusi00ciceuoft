nores, x111. 44—x1v. 47. 71

§st foris: an abl. form, expresses both place where. and plns-a·
whence; it means “out ot doors,’‘ ·· wsthouts‘ and is the opposite of
‘⁶ intud' The acc. form, expressing motion, issara«. It is derived
from the same root assiu-is, -e's, fem, a door.

sapien· solum: we should have expected the adj. solus agrecing
with sapiens rather than the adv. solnm.

amputata: the word amputa, to cut round, lop off, eomes from
‹zm-ambi, around, and puta», to cleanse, prune. The meaning ta
think, which is generally associated with puto. is derived from that
of to pruno, set in order, arrange ; hence as applied to accounts or
thoughts-to reekon. think.

inanitate: the Greek word in Epicurus is κενοδοξία, vanity, con-
ceit.

§45- partitio: the division, as explained in the next sentence. is
into three classes: (l) the desires which are both natural and
necessary; (2) those which are natural though not necessary; and
(3) those which are neither natural nor necessary.

quarum ea ratio est ut =and the account (relation) ot them is such
that, i.e. they are such that . . . . Necessariae seems to stand here
for naturales et necessariae, naturales for naturales neo tamen
ravenaria-e, inanex for nec· natm-ales nee mvexsariae.

opera multa : abl. of instrument. Opera, -ae, fem.=service, pains,
and implies a free will and desire to serve ; while opus, -eris, n., is
generally used of mechanical work, as that of animals, slaves and
soldiers. Operae in the pl.==labourers, workmen.

XIV. §46. vindicet: vindica from τῐηι and tli00=to assert force
or authority over; hence = to claim; hence. since, if you claim an
obiect from another object, you set the first object free from the other
object, vindicare came to mean ‘⁵ to free, set free, emancipate.'’

omnis: acc. pl. See G. ς’ 39.

lerant: cf. the use ot the English word bear in “ bearings,'' “bear
to your right,'’ etc.

ξ 47. temperantiam: the second of the four Cardinal VirtueS, which
are: (l) sapientia (ἓξ 43-46), (2) temperantia (ἐξ 47, 48), (3) forti-
tudo (ξ 49), and (4) justitia (ᾖς’ 50--53), the Greek equivalents οἱ
which are, respectively, σοφία, σωφροσύνη, ἀνδρεία, and δικαιοσύνη.

placet : this word. the 3rd sing. pres. subjunct. ot phion 1, must be
distinguished from placet, the 3rd sing. pres. indic. ot placeo 2.

non faciendumve : the two words nonfacere are regarded as one
compound verb, say =snqiendnm ,· so instead of quid faciendum
fieqiendumre sit we have here quid sumendum mvn faciendumve sit.
Similarly we have ‘voluptati-³ non dolendive particeps. ι

† quod sit judicatum ε some editions read est, and say the subjunct.
has crept in through confusion with the preceding faciendumve sip.
The difference in meaning between the xit (expressing a certain
amount of hesitation), and est (asserting a fact), is slight, and can be
easily distinguished : ⁴¹· whatever” may be used in translating the
former, and ‘⁶ what‚” if the indic. be used.
