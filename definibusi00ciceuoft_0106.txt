neglect their duties through effeminacy of mind, i.e., avoid-
ance of toils and pains. And between these cases, at all
events, it is an easy and straightforward matter to distin-
guish. At a free moment, when our choice and option is
quite open, 31111 when there is nothing to hinder us from
being able to do what we most like, all pleasure is to be
taken, and all pain is to be cast aside. But on certain
occasions, and either through the obligations of duty or

exploits, which without doubt are illustrious, for any cause
at all, virtue for its own sake was not that cause. He
dragged the necklet from his foe, you say? Yes, but he
protected himself to save his life. But, say you, he went to
meet a great danger. Yes, in the sight of the army. Well,
and what did he get by that‘l Praise and love, the best
securities for passing life without fear. He punished his son
