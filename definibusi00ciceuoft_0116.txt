had undertaken many mighty labours. (61) Then, too,
see how some are insignificant and narrow-minded, 01·

always despairing or malie-icus, envious, morose, workers .

in darkness and speakers of evil, and sullen3 how others
are given up to amorous trivialities 3 how others are fretful,
others foolhardy and wauton, and at the same time intem-
perate and cowardly‚ and changeable of mind. And by
reason of these things there is, in their life, no respite
from trouble. Wherefore, neither of the foolish is there

And he does not depend upon the future, but looks forward

those vices which I just now grouped together. When he
compares the life of the foolish with his own he experiences
a great pleasure. If, however, any pains do crop up, they
never have so much force that the wise man does not have
more reason to rejoice than to grieve.

(63) “ Epicurus spoke admirably when he said that fortune
interfered very little with the wise man 3 that matters of
the greatest and most serious moment were managed by
him on his own responsibility and judgment 3 and that no
greater pleasure could be got from an infinite period of
