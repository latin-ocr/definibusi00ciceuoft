8 emmo DE rmlssus 1.

It was very bold in Cicero to undertake this defence, but
his boldness was equalled by his eloquenoe, and his success
on this occasion placed him at once amongst the best
orators of the day. Ill-health obliged him to retire to
Athens, where he continued his study of rhetoric and philo-
sophy for two years, returned to Rome in 77 B.c., and was
elected quaestor in 76 B.c. He served this office in Sicily,
and acquired golden opinions from the natives through his
integrity, impartiality‚ and self—denial. In 74 B.c. he re-
turned to Rome, and again devoted himself to his profession
as an advocate. In 70 B.c. he undertook the impeachment
of Verres, who was charged by the Sicilians with having
been guilty of misgovernment, oppression, and extortion
during his quaestorship in Sicily from 73-71 B.c. Horten-
sius, the consul-elect for the following year, was Verres's
advocate, and on behalf of his client was anxious that the
trial should be delayed until the next year, when the
presiding praetor would be more favourably disposed to the
defendant. Cicero frustrated this attempt by getting his
evidence ready in half the time allowed, and by opening
his case very briefly and proceeding at once to the ex-
amination of his witnesses. The In Verrem as we possess
it was not the speech he actually delivered, but a speech
which he published after the trial as representing what he
would have said had the case run the usual course. The*
result of Cicero’s onslaught was that Verres departed at
once into exile without even attempting a defence.

In 69 Ro. Cicero was aedile, in 66 13.c. praetor, and in
63 B.c. consul. During his consulship he had to deal with
the famous conspiracy of Catiline. In his efforts to crush
it Cicero imprisoned some of the participators in the plot,
and ordered them to be put to death without being tried
before the people. For his services on this occasion 'ne
received the thanks of the whole people, and was dignified
by the name of pater patriae. But his enemy Clodius, by
calling public attention to the illegal execution of the con-
spirators‚ brought about the orator's banishment in 58 B.c.
Cicero's friends actively exerted themselves to procure his
return, and succeeded in their efforts in 57 Rc. In 53 B.c.
he was admitted into the Oollege of AugurS‚ and in the
