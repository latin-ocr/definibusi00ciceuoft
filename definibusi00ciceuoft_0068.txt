voluptatis : partitive genitive depending on qnid.

nec dixeris ; ⁴ don't says for this form of the imperative see G. ξ 420.
Also compare Democritum nollem vituperatmu in §21 = 1 wou't
have Democritus slandered. See G. ξ 446.

haec . . . illa: haee this nearer to me = the latter, illa = that
farther off. yonder = the former.

voluptati: the predicative dative; the latter are to me sor a
pleasure: the dative together with the verb forming the predicate.
This dative is classed in the Grammar under the heading Dative ot'
Pul-pose or Res-ult. see G. §291

† neque Metrodorus 2 this is a happy emendation for neque reru tv,
the reading of the MSS. Metrodorus of Lampsacus. B.C. 324—277,
was the most distinguished ot the disciples of Epicurus. whom he
would have succeeded as the head ot the Epicurean School had he
not died before his master. His philosophy was more sensual than
that of Epicurus. i* There is another reading, neque vestri.

saperet . . . didicisset: subjunctive after hypothetica] qni, 01· qui
introducing a class. See G. ξ 475.

quod quaeritur saepe: as to the question that is often put, why,
etc.‚ this sentence is a noun-sentence in apposition with eur, etc.

laetitiam id est voluptatem: Cicero is extremely elever in finding
Latin equivalents for Greek words, but he often experiences some
difficulty. Here laetitia is too weak, and voluptas too strong for
ηδονή.

referatur: we should have expected the imperf. referretur after
concederetm·,· the present is irregular, but is to be explained as
being used (1) for the sake of vividness, or (2) to express a possible
condition, 01· (3) as outside the main conditional sentence in the
same way as quad minime ille vult is outside it.

§26. doctrinis: Epicurus is constantly reproached by Cicero for
the deficiency in his literary education and studies. Epicurus, on >
the other hand. was convineed that education was not necessary or
desirable except in so far as it taught how to live happily. See infra,
ξ 71.

vellem fuisset: this construction after volo, nolo, and malo (the
ut being understood) is very common. See G. ξ 447.

quas qui tenent eruditi appellantur : “The possessors of which are
called learned.” This is good idiomatic Latin, though in English we
could not have two relatives at the beginning of a sentence. Cf. qua
qui utuntur in ς’ 52, qua qui est imbutus in ξ 60, and quos qui tollunt
in ξ 64.

VIII. quoquo: from qmzequis, whoever. Distinguish quisquam,
any (used in negative and comparative sentences, and in interrogative
sentences expecting the answer no); quiz-Le, quilibet, any one you
please ; and quisque = each.

intellegere quid diceret: the subjunct. here is the ordinary
subjunct. in an indirect question. See G. §433
