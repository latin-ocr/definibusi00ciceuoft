Pisto (§§ ὅ, T) : the great Greek philosopher. horn nt Athens in
429 B.c., was a disciple of Socrates until the death of the latter in
899. After this event he retired to Mega1·a‚aml then travelled about,
visiting Egypt, Sicily, and Magna Graecia. When he returned to
Athens, about 389 B.c.‚ he set up a school at the Academy, whence
his followers were called Academ ies (see Introduction, av. Academiae).
He died 347 B.c. As regards his philosophy, Plato elaborated his
(lialecticah ethical‚ and political systems ; but. save in his Timaeus,
laid comparatively little stress on physics. His moral and political
philosophy are noble and sublime; perhaps too noble and sublime
to be of much practical use. He taught that wisdoni was the supreme
good, aud that the soul was immortal‚ emanating from the Deity, who
was an eternal and sels-existent cause, and the origin and creator ot*
everything. It was man's office to be temperate, just, and pure. In
politice the state as a whole was all-important, the individua] being
important only as a member of the state. So closely connected are
they, that politics aud ethics are with Plato almost inextricably inter-
woven. It was left for Aristotle to distinguish between them, just as
he broke up Plato's Dialectic into metaphysics, logie, and rhetoric.
Plato's great theory is that of the Ibem-viz„ that the objects which
we see (τὰ. φαινόμενα) are non-existent, but merely copies and emana-
tions from the divine ἰδέα or form, which only the soul or intellectual
part of our nature is capable of perceiving ; hence all knowledge
must be innato and acquired by the sou] before birth. These ἰδέαι
formed the ‘⁴ copiug-stone '‘ of Plato’s system alike in logie, physica
and metaphysics.

Scaevola, Q. Mucius, tle« Avym· (ἐξ S, 10) : son-in-law of C. Laelius
(born about 157 B.c., died not earlier than 88 B.c.), was praetor of
Asia in 121 ΒΩ. While on his way to Asia, at Athens, he met
T. Albucius, who prided himself so much upon his knowledge and

for some other weightier reasons, Albucius prosecuted Scaevola on
his retum to Rome for extortion in his province, but the charge was
not sustained. Scaevola‘s family had produced a series of great
lawyers, among whom he himself was not the least renowned. He
figures as a speaker in the De Oratore and several other works
of Cicero.

Scaevola, P. Mucius, the Pontiff (ξ 12); tribune of the plebs
Rc. 141, consul B.c. 133. He succeeded his brother Mucianus as
Pontifex Maximus in B.c. 131, and died some time after B.c. 121.
He was noted for his skill in the ,ius pontificium. Besides being a
famous lawyer, he was an eloquent but rather diffuse orator. He also
compiled and published in eighty books a digest of the Annales
