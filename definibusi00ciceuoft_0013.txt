following year acted as proconsul and commanded in the
province of Cicilia, where he conducted some successful
military operations.

It has been stated above that Cicero was a novus homo,
and as such would naturally belong to the democratic party.
From the date of his consulship, however, he seems to have
attached himself to the optimate-9, or aristocratic party, and
accordingly at the outbreak of the civil war in 49 13.C.‚ after
some hesitation, he joined Pompey, but subsequently, after
the battle of Pharsalia in 48 B.C.‚ he was reconciled to Caesar.
After the death of Caesar, 44 B.c., an open rupture ensued
between him and Antony, and Cicero gave vent to his anger
and indignation in the famous “ Philippic Orations,'’ foui-teon
speeches, the finest and most renowned of which is the·
second. From the beginning of 43 B.o. until the end of
April Cicero was in the height of his glory, but before the
end of that year, in the proscription that followed upon
the formation of the triumvirate, Cicero’s name was, on the·
suggestion of Antony, which was not opposed by Octavianus,
put in the list of those doomed to immediate destruction.
Soldiers were at once sent in put-suit, and although his
attendants wished to offer opposition, Cicero forbade them,
and stu-rendered to his pursuers, by whom he was imme-
diately killed.

In the foregoing sketch no mention has been made of
Cicero's philosophica] works, which were both numerous
and important. His activity in this direction begins from
his exile in 57 Rc. ; in 55 B.c. he produced the De Oratore,
in 54 B.c. the De Re Publica, and in 52 B.c. the De
Leqibus. This period of activity was followed by five years
(51 to 46 Rc.) of comparative rest, but in 46 B.c. he wrote
the Hortensius or De Philosophia, a treatise now lost, in
addition to the Partitiones Oratoriae, the Brutus or De*
Claris Oratoribus, and the Orator. During the years 45
and 44 B.c. he wrote the De Consolatione, on the occasion
of the death of his daughter Tullia 3 the Academica, an
account of the new Academic Philosophy, which main-
tained that there was no such thing as certainty—we must
be content with probability3 the Disputationes Tusculanae,
treating of happiness and morality 3 the De Natura Deorum,
