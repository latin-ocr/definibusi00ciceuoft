68 CICERO DE F1N1nus 1.

sanciret: sanein = to render sacred or inviolable (the meaning
herc) 3 hence it came to mean (l) to ratify ; (2) to devote, dedicate
to some one ; and (3) to forbid under pain of punishment. The
sanction of law has two meanings in English: (l) permission given
by the law ; and (2) the penalty by which a law is enforced.

§36- haec ratio late patet: this method of reasoning has a wide
application.

eo dilectu constituto ut: ⁴⁶ when such a plan os: choice has been
established that? etc.

XI. §31 erit enim jam: jam = already, soon3 approximates in
meaning closely to mmz‘.

propius disserendi locus z infr-a, chap. xiii.

voluptas ipsa quae qualisque sit: cf. ξ 29. “quid et quale sit id,
de quo quaerimus.⁷’

continens z temperate, moderate, sels-restrained.

liberatione : liberatiffi like many other abstracts in -2'0‚ has both an
active and a passive meaning, im. = (1) a releasing, setting free;
and (2) the meaning here, a becoming free, being set free. See also

40, allevatio.
ἓ §38. quiddam: quoddam is the neut. adj, and quiddam is the
pronominal substantive from quidam.

omni dolore careret : ear-eo and eqeo mostly govern the abl. ς
’ὶηᾱᾰφεο generally takes the gen.; careo always takes the abl. in
Cicero⁷ and is found with the gen. only in ante-classical poets. quo
is very rarely, if at all, found with the gen. in Cicero 3 but Plautus,
Horace, Caesar and Tacitus use the gen. frequently.

quisquis: see note on quoquo, ξ 26.

† omnis autem privatione doloris : the MSS. read omni, and regard
privatione doloris as one compound word. But against this reading,

which seems both natural and intelligible, some authorities urge that v

Cicero wished to express not complete freedom from pain, but

freedomt from all kind of pain, and have accordingly changed the
munz m Ο omnis.

terminari: = limited, fixed, defined.

augeri: this is an instance of asyndeton; in English we should
use some adversative conJ'unction, ay. but. Auqeo = ‘to increase,
make larger (trans.); and cresco = to increase, grow larger (in-
trans).

ξ 39. a patre: the more usual preposition would be e instead of a.
The father was L. Manlius Torquatus, consul with Cotta in ΒΩ. 65.
Catiline conspired with Paetus and Sulla, who after election ‘to the
consulship had lost their office through corrupt practices, in order to
kil] Torquatus and Cotta; but the conspiracy was unsuccessful.
After his consulship Torquatus obtained the province of Macedonia;
in consequence of his exploits in his province, on the motion of
Cicero, the senate conferred on him the title of imperator. In
B.0. 63 he helped to subdue Catiline’s conspiracy, and in 58 he
opposed the banishment of Cicero.
