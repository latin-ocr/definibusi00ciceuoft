14 CICERO m: FINIBUS 1.

Among his teachers were Thales and Anaximander. He
travelled extensively in Egypt, Phoenicia, and Babylon,
the history and state of which countries modified his
philosophical system. He studied deeply the sciences of
arithmetic and geometry‚ and attached to abstract number
a mysterious importance which his followers, the Pytha-
goreans, increased and developed. He had also lofty
ethical and politica] views——especially insisting on purity
of life and duties to friends 5 in which, in the importance
attached to number, and in the distinction between τὸ
πέρας and τὸ ἄπειρον, he largely influenced later Gre'ek
thought, particularly that of Plato. He also held the doctrine
of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls. He was,
however, not merely a thinker, but also a doer. Believing
that he had a divine mission to perform in disseminating
his views, he formed religious brotherhoods in Croton.
These had made ramifications throughout Magna Graecia 3
but, on becoming political organisations, they were sup-
pressed in the demociatic inteiest. They suivived meiely
as a philosophica] sect.

No separate account need be given of Socrates (469- -399
B..,c) as, although his teaching had a most powerful and
plactical effect on his contempomries and a very lasting
influence on succeeding thought, it is best seen as developed
by his disciples Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Zeno, an
account of whom wil] be found in the biographical appendix
under their respective names , These four disciples were
the founders respectively of the AOADEMICS, PERIPA-
TETICS, EPIOUREANS, and STOIOS. In addition to
these four principa] schools, there were three minor schools
which arose out of the teaching of Socrates, viz. (1) the
MEGARIG, founded by Euclides of Megara, and called
also the Βίαῖεοιὶο, or Eristic, which laid great stress on the
importance of discussion and logic3 (2) the OYRENAIG,
founded by Aristippus of Oyiene‚ in Afiica; and (3) the
OYNIO, founded by Antisthenes, an Athenian, who taught
in the‘ ‘Cynosarg σο3,’ a gymnasium at Athens, from the
name of which his followers were called Cynics, though
some people say it was on account of thei1 dog· like (κυνικὸς,
κύων), uncivilised habits. Diogenes of Sinope was one of the
