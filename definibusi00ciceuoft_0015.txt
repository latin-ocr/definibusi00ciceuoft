In Book I. Torquatus enunciate} the doctrines of EpicurusX f
in response to an attack made ¹lpon them by Cicero. (In
one of his letters Cicero calls t is book Torquatus, because
of the important part taken by orquatus in the discussion.)
Book II. gives the reply of the Stoa-s, and their arguments
against the whole system of Epicurus ε this takes the form s
of a dialogue between Cicero and Torquatus.

The scene of the second discussion, which compris-es
Books III. and IV.‚ is laid in the 111111 of Lucullus at
Tusculum in the year 52 Β.0., Cicero using the arguments
of the New Academy against the Stoic principles of Cato.
In Book III. Cicero maintains that there 13· 110 real
difference between the Stoics on the one hand, and the
Old Academy and Peripatetics on the other. Cato at
once asserts that the Stoic doctrines are quite distinct
and immeasurably superior. leicero’s. reply to Cato is
contained in Book IV. l

The third discussion, 113 contained in Book V.‚ is earliest
in point of time, and is supposed to take place in Athens
in the year 79 13.c. The speakers are Cicero, his brother
Quintus, his cousin Lucius, M. Pomponius Atticus and
M. Pupius Piso. This last gives‘a full description of the
doctrines of the Peripatetics (as inculcated by Aristotle and
his followers) 3 and Cicero br' gs forward the objections of
the Stoics against these docissmes. The book closes with
Piso' s reply. q

It is to be noticed that in 119110 of these (11301133 10113 does

Cicero profess to enunciate hismsm philosophica] convictions.
In the first and third discussions (which are in 01de1 of
date the* third and first discussions) he gives the objections
of the Stoics against the Epiqiireans and Peripatetics
respectively; and in the second discussion (third in date)
he refutes the opinion of the Stoics by means of those of
the New Academy. From this fact and from others we are
led to infer that, while Cicero had the highest appreciation
of the Stoical system, in 1113 own mind Che inclined more
closelyto the doctrines of the N ew Academy, which doubted
the possibility of attaining absolute t1 uth and was content
with probability. The ethica] principles of the two systems
were very similar.
