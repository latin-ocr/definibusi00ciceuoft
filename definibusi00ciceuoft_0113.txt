sent them by the inimortal gods as a punishment. So, 1 ask,
what help can accrue from wicked ‹leeds towards 16886111111,Γ
the troubles of life so great as that which acc-rues to their
increase from the conscience of 0111· misdeeds, as well as by
' the penalty of the laws and the loathing of our follow-
citizens? Yet with som(¹ people there is no limit of money,
of rank, of power, of lust& of feasting‚ and the rest of the
desires, which no plunder wickcdly won ever les-sens, but
rather inflames 3 it seems they must be chccked rather than
schooled to the opposite.

(52) “True reason, therefore, draws the truly sane to
justice, fail-ness, and faithfulness. Deeds unjustly done do
not profit the man who is powerless over his words and
actions; for he can neither effect with ease what he attempts,
nor keep his gains if he succeeds. The resources either of
fortune or of talent go best with generosity, and those who
practise that win for themselves goodwill and—what con-
duces more than aught else to living peacefully—affection,
particularly as men have then no reason to go astray.

(53) “Now the desires which spring from nature are
easily and harmlessly satisfied; but those which are vain
must not be obeyed. For they orave for nothing desirab103
and there is more harm in the injury they cause than
benefit in the things which are attained by the hai-m. And
so let no one say that even justice is to be wished for
in itself, but only because it brings with it perhaps the
maximum of pleasantness. For to be loved and to be dear
is pleasant, because it makes life safer and more full of
pleasures. And so it is not only on account of those
inconveniences which befall the wicked‚ that we think wicked-
1168818 to be shunned, but it is much more because wickedness
never allows to breathe or rest him whose mind it haunts.
(54) But if not even the merit of the virtues themselves,
over which the talk of *the rest of philosophers so largely
rejoioes, can find any definite issue, unless it be referred to
pleasure, and if it is pleasure alone that of its own nature
. calls 118 to itself, and attracts us, it cannot be doubtful that
pleasure is the highest and furthest of all good things,
and that to live happily is nought else but to live with
pleasure.
