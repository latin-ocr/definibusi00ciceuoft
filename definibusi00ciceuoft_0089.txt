account for things by reference to that of wl1 5071 they were made, and
even Anaxagoras had only added to this explanation a νοῦς by which
they were made ; Aristotle considered the Ιιοιυ and wllerqfsme of their
being. In ethim he regarded well-being as the highest good, which
he said was attained by the active exercise of our natural powers:
virtue he defined as “a habit lying in a mean, between two
extreme vices.’' In polita-x he formed his views from a searching
examination of existing politicsv and differentiated the functions of
government as deliberative, legislative and judicial. In natm-al
history he showed appreciation of the necessity of experiment. The
acute thinkers of the Middle Ages gave as much weight to his dic-ta
as to the words of the Bible.

Democritus (ξς 17-21, 28, etc.): Democritus was born at Abdera,
in ,ΤΗΙ-800, B.c. 460. He travelled over a considerable portion of
Egypt and various countries in Asia, and after returning to his native
land devoted himself to philosophy. He adopted with modifications
the system of Leucippus, the founder of the atomio theory. Accord-
ing to Democritus, there' is, in the infinite void of space, an infinite
number of atoms which, though alike 111 quality are different in
form. They are impenetrable, and therefore offer resistanee to one
another· ‚ and from their gentle collisions all things are produced.
Aristotle was not satisfied with his first cause of all existence,
necessity (ἀναγκὴ), ele. the necessary succession of cause and effect.
This cause is purely mechanical, and requires no external agent.
Similarly material were his views on the soul, which reduced it
to a collection of smooth round atoms. In ethic-8, on which hc laid
little stress‚ he thought the chief aim of man was peace of mind
(εὐθυμία, εὐεστῶ). This corresponds with Epicurus’ serenity (ἀταραξία).
For the latter’s further debts to him see §§ 17-21 and notes. Hc
seems also to have originated two antitheses ; (1) between that which
existe by nature (ἐτέῃ or φύσει) and that which exists by convention
