82 CICERO DE nmmos 1.

aeque atque: this is a slight variation on aeque et, three lines
above.

ξ 68. quosque : qnos and que has nothing to do with quaeque, each.

voluptatibus inhaererent: “inhere in pleasure‚” e'.e. arc founded
upon, inseparable from, pleasure.

his paene verbis ι Cicero is here translating the words of Epicurus
as given in Dioqenes Laena, X. 148.

ne quod: notice we have here qnod, the adjective, and not qnid,
the noun. For the use of quis instead of aliquis after ne, uisi, num,
and si, see G. ξ 383. ·

ξ 69. sunt autem quidam: this is the second view of the Epicuream
on friendship as understood by some later followers of Epicurus

convicia τ clamour, reproaches, derived probably from con and the
root of ror, a voice.

qui verentur: notice the indic. after sunt qnidam ,· it expresses a
matter of fact. while the subjunct. would express some degree of un-
certainty. Remember the rule that rerem· or timeo m> =1 fear that,
and rerem· or timeo vt = I sear that . . . not. The explanation of
this idiom‚ as far as rerem· is concerned, is that vereor is from the
same root as ὀράω, and originally meant Ι see, I take care ; so rerem·
wetfaviat = Ι take care that he may do it, ie. Ι fear that he may not
do it. and Terea]- ne faciat = I take care that he may not do it,
zze. I fear that he may do it.

claudicare: fron] claudet), claudus, lame = to halt, limp, be defec-
tive, incomplete. Cf. vacillare in ξ 66. In De Natura Deorum
both words occur together : tota res vacillat et claudicat.

primos congressus : this accus. is the subj. of fieri, which is
governed by dieunt understood.

consuetudinum ε consuetudo (from eamve-een) = (1) a custom,
habit; (2) usage as a common lam and as here; (3) socia-l inter-
course, intimacy.

efflorescere: this is a favourite metaphor of Cicero's3 we have a
similar one in English. It is noticeable that we have not even a
tanquam or quasi inserted so as to prepare the way.

campum ι refers specially to the Campus Martius.

ludicra : used as a noun by Horace also (Epp, Ι. i. 10) ; it would
embrace what Horace elsewhere enumerates as “ jocos venerem,
convivia, ludum.” The adj. has no masc. sing. nom.

exercendi : used here intransitively, or we may understand se ; the
gerund, as here, is often used and especially in the gen„ instead of
the verbal substantive, ay. ereo-citatio, venatio.

adamare : “to begin to love,’' then ‘· to love exceedingly.”

ξ 70. sunt autem, qui : this is the third view, and, like the second,
is the view of a later Epicurean, and not of Epicurus himself.

qui dicant : notice the subJ'unct. dicant, and compare it with the
indie. in suut quidam qvi ‘verentur in ξ 69.

† ut ne: see G. ξ 449. Boeckel reads ne minus quidem, following
one MS.; but though the reduplication of ut ne is avoided by this

reading, the sense is not improved.
