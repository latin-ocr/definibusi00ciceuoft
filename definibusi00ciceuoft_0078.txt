74 CICERO nn nmmos 1.

he would use any of the following expressions : noctes diesque, noctes
et dies, et dies et noctes, dies noctesque.

cum conscientia: enumerem is the abl. of instrument; cum . . .
tum conjunctions.

† et potius inflammat: the et has been inserted, and does not
appear in some MSS. Some MSS. have potins alone, and some
potius atque ; whence Holstein reads potiusque, and Teubner et
potius. There is no need to change the et or qne into sed, because,
as we saw in ς’ 41, note on omnesque, a que after a negative sentence
has often to be translated by hut, since the affirmation is opposed to
or contrasted with the negative statement.

ξ 52. fidem: for the asyndeton, in omitting et, see G. ξ 561.

infanti: infans, which is derived from vin = not, and sor,fari‚ to
speak, is here used in its literal sense of not speaking, unable to
speak, not eloquent. Similarly impotenti = without power 01· ability.

conducunt: conduco = (1) to bring together, collect3 (2) to hire,
take on lease ; and (3) (neuter, used impersonally for the most part
only in the present, sing. and pl.) to be of use to, to profit.

et opes ; the et corresponds to the neque at the beginning of the
sentence.

qua qui utuntur: for the two relatives at the beginning ot the
sentence, cf. note on ξ 26, qvas qm: tenent.

quiete : the adv. of quietae ; it could not here be the abl. of quies
= with quietness‚ because in these kinds of adverbial phrases we
must add either a preposition (“·.'l· eum quiete) or an adjective
(eff. tanta quiete).

ξ 53. detrimenti ; like emolumenti is a partitive genitive.

dixerit : notice the negative imperative ne quis clia-erit = ‘·' let no
one call.’⁷ See G. ξ 420. ‘ The perf. subjunct. is mostly, but not solely,
used with the 2nd pers.. and the pres. subjunct. with the 3rd.

afferat ε subjunct. because it is in a dependent sentence in a kind
of oratio obliqua. A sed qnia, introducing a true reason in direct
statement, is generally followed by an indic. See G. ἐξ 487, 488.

qu'us ε the antecedent of cuju-s· is curn. 111 eum respirare.

ξ 54. exitum : another synonym for the summum- bonnm, ultimum
bonum, eoetremum bonum, orfine‘s.

derigatur : for the spelling of this word, see note on ξ 57.

suapte: for the termination -pte added to the abl. οἱ possessive
adjectives in order to strengthen them, see G. ξ 79, obs. 2.

XVII. ξ 55. brevi: an adv. = ⁴ briefly,'' “ in a few words.'’ This
form is very frequently found in Cicero, instead of the fuller breviter.

in iis rebus, cum ; = in. νο quod. in the fact that.

cadere eausa : “falL or fail, in their case,'’ ‘·' lose their case,’‘
v'ae. are found to be wrong. Causa is here used in the technical sense
of law-suit. ·

afferat : the subjunctive, expressing a possibility or probability
rather than an assertion. Quamquam is usually followed by the
indie. in Cicero. See G. ξ 503.
