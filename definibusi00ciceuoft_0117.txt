In that logie os yours 110 thought there was· no force either
for living better 01· for arguing more to the point. Ile put
most stress on physica ln that branch of knowledge the
force of words, the character of an exposition, and tho
arguments of people mnintaining or rehutting a- theory, can
all be readily followed3 and when wc know the nature ot·
all things we are liberated from superstition, we are freed
from the sear of death, we are not disti-aught by our
ignorance of things—from which alone awful terrors often
take their being 5 in a word, we shall also he more moral when
we have learnt what nature calls for. In fine, if we hold
fast to a sound knowledge of things, maintaining that rule
which seems to have come down from heaven for the
cognition of all things, and by which all our judgments
about things are guided, we shall never be convinced by the
arguments of any one, and abandon our belief.

(64) ‘⁶ But if the nature of things has not been understood
we shall in no way be able to defend the judgments of the
senses. Nay, more: whatever we perceive with the mind
all springs out of the senses ; and it is only if these are all
true, as Epicurus’ theory teaches uS, that anything can be
perceived and known. Those who do away with the senses,
and say that nothing can be perceived, cannot, having put
the senses aside, even account for the very fact that they
discuss. Moreover, with the removal of cognition and know-
ledge is removed also every method of life and action. And
thus from physics is derived fortitude against the fear of
death, firmness against religious awe, calmness of mind when
ignorance of things hidden is done away with, and modera-
tion when the nature and kinds of desires are revealed;
and, as Ι just now told you, by the rule of cognition, and
by the method of judgment established by the same great
man, the distinction between true and false is imparted

the most essential to this discussion. I mean friendship,
which you assert will never exist at all if pleasure be the
highest good. About friends-bip Epicurus says this: that
