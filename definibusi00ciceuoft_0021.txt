which he had for=me11y h· id with Tor:qu itus and T1im'us at
his estate at Cumae.

Cicero points out the defects in (1) the natural philosophy
(ἓξ 17- -,21) (2) the logie οι· dialectic (§2 2), md (3) the ethii-s
of Epicurus' system (ἐξ 23- 26). In n itur· -11 philosophy (8.9.
his atomio theory) he has nothing original, but has borrowcd
everything from Democritus and others: when at times he
has not borrowed outright but has tried to impl-ove their
theorics, instead of making them better he has made them
worse. He had no skillin arguing, and laid down no rules
for the help of others. He made pleasure the chief good,
a view which was both short-sighted and wanting in
originality.

Cicero puts these views in an aggressive shape so as to
make Torquatus defend his master: Torquatus accepts the
challenge‚ and prefers to adopt a continuous speech rather
than a dialogue (ἐξ 26- 28).

CHAL’ IX· XXI. —A discussion of Epicurus’ teaching as)
expounded by Torquatus.

CHAP. IX. —Pleasure is the chief good and pain the
chief evil. Experience shows that every animal from the
moment of its birth seeks pleasure as the chief good and
avoids pain as the chief evil. This is a matter of perception
or experience‚ and requires 110 reasoning or argument. But
although it stands in need of no argument, arguments can
be brought forward, and Torquatus thinks it better so
to do.

CHAP. X.—No one avoids pleasure because it is pleasure
and no one seeks pain because it is pain 3 but peop'le
avoid or give up some pleasures in order to obtain greater
pleasures, and seek and endure some pains in order to avoid
greater painS. So the elder Torquatus risked death, but it
was in order to obtain glory and the affection of his
countrymen 3 he ordered his son to be executed, but it was
in order to provide for the safety of his fellow-citizens‚ on
which depended his own safety.

CHAP. XL-Epicurus’ doctrine of pleasure, instead of
being voluptuous and effeminate, is dignified and temperate.
Pleasure is not merely active, causing a pleasant sensation
by working on the feehngs, but is also inactive or restful,
