62 CICERO Du FINIBUS 1.

inermis ε from in and arma, without arms ; hence defenceless.

nihil de dividendo ac partiendo docet: in addition to his neglect
of definition-—which secures dixte'twtnmszx· of thought and expression-
he omits to expound classitication and divi ion, whose business is to
make thought and language char.

quo modo efficiatur concludaturque ratio: how ieasoning is to be
effected and conclusions obtained, with special reference to the
Syllogismand Deductive reasoning generall).

captiosa . . . ambigua: no theory of Fallaeies, like Aristotle’s
Σοφιστικοὶ ἔλεγχοι.

ξ23. confirmat: there is probably an ellipse here of some part
which has been lost. At any rate Cicero appears to dismiss in one
paragraph (ξ 22) 3 subject much larger than the first, which occupied
five paragraphs (§§ 17-21).

ad haec . . . refert omnia: according to Epicurus, pleasure was
the standard by which to measure conduct. Other such standai-ds
have been virtue—‘⁴ the happiness of the greatest number ³²—self-
realization.

Aristippi : the possessive gen„ not the predicative gen.

a Cyrenaicisque : notice the peculiar position of que. We might
have expected defendit‘nrquc (ι Cyrenaicis, Cf. ξ 2.

neque eum Torquatum: there is no second 'neque to correspond
with the 'neque here, but we have in its place the graphio Quid ἑ)
at beginning of ξ 24. T. Manlius Torquatus, son of L. Manlius
Capitolinus, in the war of Rc. 361, slew in single combat a gigantic
Gaul who had challenged any Roman to fight him. From the dead
body Manlius took the torque-⁸², or chain, and placed it round his own
neck. and was on that account called Torquatus. He was dictator
in 353 and 349, and consul in 347, 344, and 340. In 340 his col-
league was P. Decius Mus, who, by his sels-sacrifice, gained a great
victory over the Latius. Previous to the battle, the consuls had
ordered that no Roman should engage in single combat with a
Latin, on pain of death ; but young Manlius, stung by the insults of
a Tuscan noble, accepted his challenge, and slew him. The father,
instead of being proud of his son's prowess, ordered him to be
executed for the breach ot' military discipline.

cognomen : a Roman's nomen was the name of his [lens ,· in addition
to this, he had a praemoneri, (³41. Publius, Quintus, and generally a
evgslwmm (the lmine of liis family, which was a division of the ‚qen-3),
eff. Rumpimus, Strabo. Scipio. Some Romans also had an αῃηοηιυη,
or extra name, eff. Manlianus, Africanus, Asiaticus. See G. ς’ 933.

tertio consulatu : ΒΕ. 340. See snpra.

apud Veserim: Veseris, a river in Campania.

securi: this refers to the secures or axes of the lictors who were
ordered by the consul to exeeute young Manlius. Distinguish
securis, an axv. from saterris, the dat. or abl. pl. of securus = free
from care.

ξ 24. Quid? see snpra, eomesponds to neque in neque eum
Torquatum.
