2 CICERO DE F1N1BUS 1.

once it has been started, cannot be repressed or checked.
Hence, we should almost regard the former, who call us
altogether away fiom philosophy as more just than the
latter, who appoint a limit for thing s unlimited, and yearn
for mediocrity 111 3 matter which increases in excellence in
pioportion to its greatness. (3) For if we can arrive at
wisdom, we must not only acquire it, but must enjoy it also.
If this is hard, still there is 110 11111113 to the search after truth‚
save its discovery 3 and weariness in your investigation is
base, just because its object 15 1110513 beautiful. Further, if
we are delighted when we write, who is 50 10310115 35 130 drag

so—to the Roman name as to despise or fling aside the
“ Medea '' of Ennius, or the “ Antiope '' of Pacuvius, because
he asserts that he 15 delighted with the same plays of
Euripides while he hates Latin literature. ‘2 “Shall I,'' says

. he,‘ ‘pread the‘ Synephebi' of Caecilius or the‘ Andria' of

' Terence, lather than the originals of both of them in
Menander2” (5) But I differ so much from these, that
although Sophocles has written an “ Electra ’' in, perhaps,
the best possible manner, still I should think I ought to
read the bad translations of Atilius, whom Licinus called
“ an iron—like writer ''-a true remark, I think3 but still he
is a writer, and one to be read. For to be entirely unversed
