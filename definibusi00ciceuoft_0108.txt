a state of pain. And Epicurus holds that the highest good
is limited by relief from pain, so that afterwards pleasure
may be altered and differentiated, but not increased or
augmented.

(39) “At Athens, as I used to hear my father say when
ridiculing the Stoics with courteous wit, there is in the
Ceramicus a statue of Chrysippus sitting with outstretched
hand. This hand tells us that he had been delighted with
this little puzzle: ‘Does your hand, affected as it now is,
desire anything2’ ‘Nothing at all.' ‘But if pleasure
were a good thing, it would desire itZ' ‘Such is my
belief! ‘Pleasure is, therefore, not a good' My father
used to say that not even a statue wouldD talk like that if
it could speak. And the conclusion tells admir ably against
the Cy renaics, but does not touch Epicuius. For if only
that were pleasure which-—if Ι may use the expression—-

tickles the senses, and floods and pervades them with its v

sweetness, neither the hand 1101 any part could be content
with fieedom from pain without a pleasant emotion. But
if the highest pleasur'e 15, as Epicurus thought, to have no
pain, then what you first allowed, Chrysippus, was right,
viz„ that you1 hand desired nothing when it was so
affected, what you next conceded—that, if pleasure were
a good, your hand would have felt desire—is wrong. It
would not feel desire for this reason: to be ⁷ without
pain is to be in a state of pleasure.

XII. (40) ‘⁴ Now that pleasure is the last of good things ἶ
may be seen very easily from 111115. Let us assume some one
enjoying many great and lasting pleasures in mind and
body with no pain impeding 01· impending3 what condition,
Ι ask you, could wo affirm to be more excellent and more
to be coveted than this? A man to be thus situated must
have the constancy of a mind which fears neither death
nor pain; for death is without feeling, and pain is
commonly light when long, and short when sharp, so that
its swiftness soothes its gieatness, and comfort soothes its
lastingness. (41) And when there is added to this the
fact that he does not dread the power of the gods, and that
